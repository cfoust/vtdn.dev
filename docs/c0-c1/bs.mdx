**BS** (Backspace) is a C0 control character that moves the cursor one position to the left. It is one of the oldest control characters, present since the original ASCII standard.

## Syntax

```
BS        0x08
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
BS = 0x08 ;
`} />

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.5, BS "causes the active data position to be moved one character position in the data component in the direction opposite to that of the implicit movement."

In standard terminal usage with left-to-right writing, this means the cursor moves one column to the left. The character at the cursor position is **not** erased — BS only moves the cursor. To delete a character, a terminal application typically sends `BS SP BS` (backspace, space, backspace) to overwrite the character with a space.

If the cursor is already at the left margin (column 1), BS has no effect. BS does not wrap to the previous line.

:::note
In the context of a line discipline (e.g., canonical mode in Unix), the kernel's terminal driver typically interprets the erase character (often mapped to backspace) by sending `BS SP BS` to the terminal. The BS control character itself only moves the cursor.

## Examples

```bash
printf 'ABC\b\b'    # Prints "ABC" then moves cursor back to 'B'
printf 'AB\b \bA'   # Prints "AB", erases 'B', prints 'A' → "AA"
```
