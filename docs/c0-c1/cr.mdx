**CR** (Carriage Return) is a C0 control character that moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line without advancing to the next line.

## Syntax

```
CR        0x0D
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
CR = 0x0d ;
`} />

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.15, CR causes the active presentation position to be moved to the line home position of the same line. In standard terminal usage, this means column 1 of the current line.

CR does not erase any characters on the line. Any subsequent output will overwrite existing characters starting from the beginning of the line.

### Interaction with LF

In Unix systems, the newline character LF (0x0A) is the standard line terminator. The terminal driver's `onlcr` setting (on by default) typically translates output LF to CR+LF so that the cursor returns to column 1 when advancing to the next line. When the terminal is in raw mode, LF alone moves down without returning to column 1.

### LNM mode

When the Line Feed/New Line Mode (LNM, DECSET mode 20) is set, a received CR causes both a carriage return and a line feed, effectively acting as a "new line" operation.

## Examples

```bash
printf 'Hello\rWorld'   # Overwrites "Hello" with "World"
printf 'ABCDEF\rXY'     # Displays "XYCDEF"
```
