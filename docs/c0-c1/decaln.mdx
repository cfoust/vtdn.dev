**DECALN** (DEC Screen Alignment Pattern) is a VT100 escape sequence that fills the entire screen with the character 'E'. It was originally intended for service personnel to test and adjust screen alignment on hardware terminals.

## Syntax

```
ESC # 8       DECALN — Screen Alignment Pattern
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
DECALN = 0x1b, "#", "8" ;
`} />

## Description

Per the VT510 manual, DECALN fills the complete screen area with a test pattern (the letter 'E' in every cell). In addition to filling the screen, DECALN:

- Resets the scrolling margins to the full screen (undoing any DECSTBM setting)
- Moves the cursor to the home position (row 1, column 1)
- Resets all character attributes to normal

Although originally designed as a hardware diagnostic tool, DECALN is commonly used in terminal emulator test suites to verify screen dimensions and scrolling behavior.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e#8'    # Fill screen with 'E' characters
```
