**DECKPAM** (Keypad Application Mode) and **DECKPNM** (Keypad Numeric Mode) are DEC VT100 escape sequences that control what the numeric keypad transmits when keys are pressed.

## Syntax

```
ESC =         DECKPAM — Enter application keypad mode
ESC >         DECKPNM — Enter numeric keypad mode
```

## Description

### DECKPAM — Application mode (ESC =)

Per the VT510 manual, DECKPAM causes the numeric keypad to send application-specific escape sequences instead of the characters printed on the keys. In this mode, each keypad key generates a unique SS3-prefixed sequence (e.g., `ESC O p` for key 0, `ESC O q` for key 1, etc.).

This mode is commonly used by full-screen applications like text editors (e.g., vi, Emacs) and TUI libraries (e.g., ncurses) that need to distinguish keypad input from regular number input.

### DECKPNM — Numeric mode (ESC >)

DECKPNM restores the keypad to its default numeric mode, where keys send the literal characters printed on them: digits 0-9, period (.), comma (,), and minus (-).

### Default behavior

The terminal defaults to numeric keypad mode on power-up and after a reset. The setting is not saved to non-volatile memory.

:::note
DECKPAM/DECKPNM function identically to the DECNKM mode (DECSET/DECRST mode 66) on the VT510. Most modern terminal emulators support both mechanisms.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e='     # Enable application keypad mode
printf '\e>'     # Return to numeric keypad mode
```
