**ENQ** (Enquiry) is a C0 control character that requests the terminal to send an answerback string. It was originally used in communication protocols to identify the remote device.

## Syntax

```
ENQ       0x05
```

### Response

When the terminal receives ENQ, it transmits its configured answerback string back to the host. On DEC VT terminals, this string was user-configurable through the terminal's setup menu.

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.44, ENQ "is transmitted by a sender as a request for a response from a receiver."

On DEC VT100 and later terminals, receiving ENQ causes the terminal to send a pre-configured answerback message. This was used to identify terminal types in multi-terminal environments and for simple challenge-response protocols.

### Modern behavior

Most modern terminal emulators respond to ENQ with an empty string or ignore it entirely, as the answerback mechanism poses a security risk: a malicious document could embed ENQ characters to trigger the terminal to "type" the answerback string into the shell, potentially executing commands.

Some terminals (e.g., XTerm) allow configuring the answerback string but default to an empty response. The DA1 (Device Attributes) sequence is the preferred modern mechanism for terminal identification.

:::warning
Configuring a non-empty answerback string can be a security risk. Untrusted input displayed in the terminal could contain ENQ characters, causing the answerback string to be injected as keyboard input.
