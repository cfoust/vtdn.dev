**HTS** (Character Tabulation Set / Horizontal Tab Set) is a C1 control function that sets a tab stop at the current cursor column.

## Syntax

```
ESC H         HTS — Set tab stop (7-bit)
0x88          HTS — Set tab stop (8-bit C1)
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
HTS = ( 0x1b, "H" ) | 0x88 ;
`} />

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.62, HTS "causes a character tabulation stop to be set at the active presentation position in the presentation component."

After issuing HTS, the current column becomes a tab stop. Subsequent HT (0x09) characters will advance the cursor to this column when the cursor is to its left.

Tab stops persist until explicitly cleared with TBC or until the terminal is reset. The default tab stops (every 8 columns) can be replaced by first clearing all stops with `CSI 3 g` (TBC) and then setting new ones with HTS at each desired position.

:::note
In 7-bit environments, HTS is sent as `ESC H`. Be careful not to confuse this with `CSI H` (CUP — Cursor Position), which moves the cursor to a specific row and column. The difference is the presence or absence of `[` after ESC.

## Examples

```bash
# Set custom tab stops at columns 5, 15, and 30
printf '\e[3g'              # Clear all tab stops
printf '\e[5G\eH'           # Move to column 5, set tab stop
printf '\e[15G\eH'          # Move to column 15, set tab stop
printf '\e[30G\eH'          # Move to column 30, set tab stop
```
