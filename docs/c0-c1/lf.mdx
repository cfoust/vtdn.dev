**LF** (Line Feed) is a C0 control character that moves the cursor down one line. It is the standard line terminator on Unix systems and one of the most frequently encountered control characters.

## Syntax

```
LF        0x0A
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
LF = 0x0a ;
`} />

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.74, LF "causes the active presentation position to be moved to the corresponding character position of the following line in the presentation component."

In default operation, LF moves the cursor down one line while remaining in the same column. If the cursor is at the bottom of the scrolling region (set by DECSTBM), the display scrolls up.

### LNM mode interaction

When the Line Feed/New Line Mode (LNM, DECSET mode 20) is set, LF additionally performs a carriage return, moving the cursor to column 1 of the next line. In the default (reset) state, LF only moves down.

### VT/FF

The Vertical Tab (VT, 0x0B) and Form Feed (FF, 0x0C) characters are treated identically to LF by virtually all terminal emulators.

### Unix line endings

Unix systems use LF alone as the line terminator. The terminal driver's output processing (specifically the `onlcr` flag) translates LF to CR+LF on output so that lines start at column 1. When the terminal is in raw mode, this translation is disabled and LF only moves the cursor down.

## Examples

```bash
printf 'Line 1\nLine 2'   # \n is LF — move to next line
```
