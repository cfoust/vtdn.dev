The **locking shifts** are escape sequences that invoke character sets G1, G2, or G3 into the GL (left) or GR (right) half of the code table. Unlike single shifts (SS2/SS3), locking shifts remain in effect until another shift is performed.

## Syntax

```
ESC n         LS2  — Locking-shift G2 into GL
ESC o         LS3  — Locking-shift G3 into GL
ESC ~         LS1R — Locking-shift G1 into GR
ESC }         LS2R — Locking-shift G2 into GR
ESC |         LS3R — Locking-shift G3 into GR
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
LS2  = 0x1b, "n" ;
LS3  = 0x1b, "o" ;
LS1R = 0x1b, "~" ;
LS2R = 0x1b, "}" ;
LS3R = 0x1b, "|" ;
`} />

The GL shifts LS0 and LS1 are the 8-bit equivalents of SI and SO respectively — see [SO/SI](/docs/c0-c1/so-si).

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.75–§8.3.81, the locking shift functions are used for code extension purposes. Their detailed semantics are defined in ECMA-35.

In the VT100/VT220 character set architecture:

- **GL** (Graphic Left, 0x20-0x7F) and **GR** (Graphic Right, 0xA0-0xFF) are the two active code areas for graphic characters.
- Four character sets — **G0**, **G1**, **G2**, **G3** — can be designated via escape sequences (e.g., `ESC ( B` for ASCII into G0).
- The locking shifts control which of G0–G3 is invoked into GL or GR.

| Shift | Invokes | Into |
|-------|---------|------|
| LS0 / SI | G0 | GL |
| LS1 / SO | G1 | GL |
| LS2 | G2 | GL |
| LS3 | G3 | GL |
| LS1R | G1 | GR |
| LS2R | G2 | GR |
| LS3R | G3 | GR |

### Practical relevance

Locking shifts beyond LS0/LS1 (SI/SO) are rarely used in modern terminals. UTF-8 has largely supplanted the ISO 2022 character set switching mechanism. Most modern terminal emulators support these sequences for compatibility but they see little practical use outside of legacy applications.
