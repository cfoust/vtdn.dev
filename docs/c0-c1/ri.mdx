**RI** (Reverse Index / Reverse Line Feed) is a C1 control function that moves the cursor up one line in the same column, scrolling the screen down if the cursor is at the top margin of the scrolling region.

## Syntax

```
ESC M         RI — Reverse Index (7-bit)
0x8D          RI — Reverse Index (8-bit C1)
```

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.104, RI "causes the active presentation position to be moved in the presentation component to the corresponding character position of the preceding line."

If the cursor is at the top margin of the scrolling region (set by DECSTBM), the screen scrolls down: all lines within the scrolling region move down one position, the line at the bottom margin is lost, and a new blank line appears at the top margin.

If the cursor is above the scrolling region or on the first line of the display, RI has no effect.

RI is the inverse of IND (Index). Together they provide symmetric single-line scrolling within the scrolling region.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\eM'     # Move cursor up one line (scroll down if at top margin)
```
