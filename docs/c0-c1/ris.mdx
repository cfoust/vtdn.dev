**RIS** (Reset to Initial State) is an escape sequence that performs a complete terminal reset, restoring the terminal to its power-on default state.

## Syntax

```
ESC c         RIS — Reset to Initial State
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
RIS = 0x1b, "c" ;
`} />

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.105, RIS "causes a device to be reset to its initial state, i.e. the state it has after it is made operational."

RIS is the most thorough reset available. On a typical terminal emulator, it performs all of the following:

- Clears the screen and scrollback buffer
- Moves the cursor to the home position (row 1, column 1)
- Resets all character attributes (SGR) to normal
- Resets all modes (DECOM, DECAWM, LNM, etc.) to their default states
- Clears all tab stops and restores the default tab stops (every 8 columns)
- Resets the scrolling region to the full screen
- Resets character set designations to their defaults
- Resets the saved cursor state (DECSC)
- Switches to the main screen buffer if the alternate screen is active

:::warning
RIS is a heavy operation. For most purposes, the soft terminal reset `CSI ! p` (DECSTR) is preferred, as it resets modes and attributes without clearing the screen or scrollback.
:::

### The `reset` command

The Unix `reset` command (typically part of ncurses) sends RIS along with other initialization sequences. It is commonly used to recover a terminal that has been left in a broken state (e.g., after a binary file has been accidentally `cat`'d).

## Examples

```bash
printf '\ec'     # Full terminal reset
```
