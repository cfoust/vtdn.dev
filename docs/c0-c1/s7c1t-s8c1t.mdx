**S7C1T** and **S8C1T** are DEC VT-series sequences that control whether the terminal sends C1 control characters as 7-bit escape sequences or as single 8-bit bytes in its responses.

## Syntax

```
ESC SP F      S7C1T — Send C1 controls as 7-bit sequences
ESC SP G      S8C1T — Send C1 controls as 8-bit single bytes
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
S7C1T = 0x1b, " ", "F" ;
S8C1T = 0x1b, " ", "G" ;
`} />

## Description

These sequences affect the format of the terminal's responses (e.g., to DA1, DSR, DECRQM queries), not how the terminal interprets input.

### S7C1T — 7-bit mode (ESC SP F)

Per the VT510 manual, S7C1T instructs the terminal to send C1 control characters in their 7-bit escape-sequence form. For example, CSI is sent as `ESC [` (two bytes: 0x1B 0x5B) rather than the single byte 0x9B.

This is the default and most common mode. It is required for compatibility with UTF-8 environments, where bytes in the 0x80-0x9F range are part of multi-byte character sequences and cannot be interpreted as C1 controls.

### S8C1T — 8-bit mode (ESC SP G)

S8C1T instructs the terminal to send C1 control characters as single bytes in the 0x80-0x9F range. For example, CSI is sent as 0x9B (one byte) instead of `ESC [`.

:::warning
S8C1T is incompatible with UTF-8 encoding, since UTF-8 uses bytes 0x80-0xBF as continuation bytes. Virtually all modern terminals operate in UTF-8 mode and either ignore S8C1T or treat it as a no-op. This mode is only meaningful in legacy 8-bit character set environments (e.g., ISO 8859-x).

### DA1 response detection

Some applications send a DA1 query (`CSI c`) and examine whether the response begins with `ESC [` or 0x9B to detect whether the terminal is in 7-bit or 8-bit mode.
