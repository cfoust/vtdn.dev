**UTF-8 select** sequences switch the terminal between UTF-8 and legacy byte-oriented character encoding. These sequences originate from ISO 2022 (ECMA-35) code-switching mechanisms.

## Syntax

```
ESC % G       Select UTF-8 encoding
ESC % @       Return to ISO 8859-1 / default encoding
```

## Description

`ESC % G` instructs the terminal to interpret subsequent input as UTF-8 encoded text. `ESC % @` reverts to the default encoding, typically ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1).

These sequences are defined in the ISO 2022 framework for announcing code structures. In ISO 2022 terms, `ESC % G` announces a "UTF-8 Level 1" coding system.

### Modern relevance

Virtually all modern terminal emulators default to UTF-8 mode and many ignore these sequences entirely, since UTF-8 is now the universal standard. The sequences are primarily relevant for:

- Legacy applications that need to explicitly switch a terminal into UTF-8 mode
- Terminal emulators that support multiple encodings and allow runtime switching

XTerm is one of the few modern terminals that fully supports switching between UTF-8 and non-UTF-8 modes at runtime via these sequences.
