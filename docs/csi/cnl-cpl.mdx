**CNL** (Cursor Next Line) and **CPL** (Cursor Preceding Line) are CSI sequences that move the cursor to the first column of a line relative to the current position.

## Syntax

```
CSI Pn E      CNL — Cursor Next Line
CSI Pn F      CPL — Cursor Preceding Line
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
CNL = 0x1b, "[", [ Pn ], "E" ;
CPL = 0x1b, "[", [ Pn ], "F" ;
Pn  = digit, { digit } ;                (* default: 1 *)
digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4"
      | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
`} />

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `Pn` | Number of lines to move | 1 |

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.12 (CNL) and §8.3.13 (CPL):

- **CNL** (`CSI Pn E`) — Moves the cursor to the first character position of the `Pn`-th following line.
- **CPL** (`CSI Pn F`) — Moves the cursor to the first character position of the `Pn`-th preceding line.

These are equivalent to CUD/CUU followed by a move to column 1. The cursor does not scroll the display when it reaches the margin.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[3E'       # Move to column 1 of 3rd line below
printf '\e[2F'       # Move to column 1 of 2nd line above
```
