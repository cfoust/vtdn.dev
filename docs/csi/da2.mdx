**DA2** (Secondary Device Attributes) is a CSI sequence that queries the terminal for its type and firmware version.

## Syntax

```
CSI > c           DA2 request (query)
CSI > Pp ; Pv ; Pc c   DA2 response
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
(* Request *)
DA2-request  = 0x1b, "[", ">", [ "0" ], "c" ;

(* Response *)
DA2-response = 0x1b, "[", ">", Pp, ";", Pv, ";", Pc, "c" ;
Pp = digit, { digit } ;                 (* terminal type *)
Pv = digit, { digit } ;                 (* firmware version *)
Pc = digit, { digit } ;                 (* ROM cartridge / always 0 *)
digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4"
      | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
`} />

## Description

Per the VT510 manual, the host sends `CSI > c` (or `CSI > 0 c`) to request secondary device attributes. The response contains three values:

- **`Pp`** — Terminal type identifier
- **`Pv`** — Firmware/software version number
- **`Pc`** — ROM cartridge registration number (always 0 on modern terminals)

### Common terminal type identifiers

| Value | Terminal |
|-------|---------|
| `0` | VT100 |
| `1` | VT220 |
| `2` | VT240 / VT241 |
| `41` | XTerm (commonly used) |
| `65` | VT510 / VT520 |

Modern terminal emulators report different values. For example, XTerm reports `41` for `Pp` and its patch level for `Pv`. Some terminals (e.g., iTerm2, kitty) use unique identifiers.

:::note
DA2 is commonly used for terminal identification in conjunction with DA1. However, relying on DA2 for feature detection is fragile since terminals may report any values they choose. The XTVERSION query or DECRQM are more reliable for specific feature detection.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[>c'
# Typical XTerm response: ESC[>41;351;0c
```
