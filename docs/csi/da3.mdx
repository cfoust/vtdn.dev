**DA3** (Tertiary Device Attributes) is a CSI sequence that queries the terminal for its unit identification string.

## Syntax

```
CSI = c           DA3 request (query)
DCS ! | Pu ST     DA3 response
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
(* Request *)
DA3-request  = 0x1b, "[", "=", [ "0" ], "c" ;

(* Response *)
DA3-response = 0x1b, "P", "!", "|", unit-id, 0x1b, "\" ;
unit-id      = hex-char, { hex-char } ;
hex-char     = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7"
             | "8" | "9" | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" ;
`} />

## Description

Per the VT510 manual, the host sends `CSI = c` to request tertiary device attributes. The terminal responds with a DCS (Device Control String) containing a unit identification code as hexadecimal characters.

On DEC hardware terminals, the unit ID was a unique factory-assigned identifier for each physical terminal. On modern terminal emulators, the response varies:

- XTerm responds with `DCS ! | 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ST` (eight zero characters)
- Some terminals respond with a hex-encoded identifier string
- Many terminals do not implement DA3 at all

DA3 is the least commonly supported of the three Device Attributes queries and has limited practical use in modern environments.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[=c'
# Typical XTerm response: ESC P ! | 00000000 ESC \
```
