**DECERA** (Erase Rectangular Area) is a CSI sequence that fills a rectangular screen region with blank characters.

## Syntax

```
CSI Pt ; Pl ; Pb ; Pr $ z    DECERA — Erase Rectangular Area
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
DECERA = 0x1b, "[", Pt, ";", Pl, ";", Pb, ";", Pr, "$", "z" ;
Pt = digit, { digit } ;                 (* top row *)
Pl = digit, { digit } ;                 (* left column *)
Pb = digit, { digit } ;                 (* bottom row *)
Pr = digit, { digit } ;                 (* right column *)
digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4"
      | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
`} />

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Pt` | Top row of the rectangle |
| `Pl` | Left column of the rectangle |
| `Pb` | Bottom row of the rectangle |
| `Pr` | Right column of the rectangle |

## Description

Per the VT510 manual, DECERA fills the specified rectangular area with blank (space) characters using the current SGR attributes. The cursor position is not changed.

Coordinates are 1-based and refer to absolute screen positions (not affected by DECOM). If coordinates exceed the screen dimensions, they are clamped.

DECERA differs from ED in that it operates on an arbitrary rectangle rather than line-oriented regions. This is part of the VT400-series rectangular area operations (along with DECFRA and DECCRA).

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[5;10;15;30$z'   # Erase rectangle from (5,10) to (15,30)
```
