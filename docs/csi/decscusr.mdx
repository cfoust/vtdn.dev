**DECSCUSR** (Set Cursor Style) is a CSI sequence that changes the cursor's shape and blink state.

## Syntax

```
CSI Ps SP q    DECSCUSR — Set Cursor Style
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
DECSCUSR = 0x1b, "[", [ Ps ], " ", "q" ;
Ps       = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" ;   (* default: 0 *)
`} />

### Parameters

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `0` | Default cursor shape (typically blinking block) |
| `1` | Blinking block |
| `2` | Steady block |
| `3` | Blinking underline |
| `4` | Steady underline |
| `5` | Blinking bar (I-beam) |
| `6` | Steady bar (I-beam) |

## Description

Per the VT510 manual, DECSCUSR sets the style of the cursor. The original DEC specification only defined values 0-2 (block cursor, blinking or steady). XTerm extended this to include underline (3-4) and bar/I-beam (5-6) styles.

The parameter `0` resets to the terminal's default cursor style. Values `1` and `0` often behave identically (blinking block), though this varies by terminal.

Odd values select blinking cursors; even values select steady (non-blinking) cursors.

The bar (I-beam) cursor styles (5-6) are a widely adopted extension originally from XTerm. Most modern terminals support all six styles, though the exact cursor dimensions and blink rate may vary.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[2 q'    # Steady block cursor
printf '\e[3 q'    # Blinking underline cursor
printf '\e[5 q'    # Blinking bar (I-beam) cursor
printf '\e[0 q'    # Reset to default cursor style
```
