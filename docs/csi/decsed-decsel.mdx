**DECSED** (Selective Erase in Display) and **DECSEL** (Selective Erase in Line) are DEC private-mode variants of ED and EL that only erase characters **not** marked as protected by DECSCA.

## Syntax

```
CSI ? Ps J    DECSED — Selective Erase in Display
CSI ? Ps K    DECSEL — Selective Erase in Line
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
DECSED = 0x1b, "[", "?", [ Ps ], "J" ;
DECSEL = 0x1b, "[", "?", [ Ps ], "K" ;
Ps     = "0" | "1" | "2" ;              (* default: 0 *)
`} />

### Parameters

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `0` | From cursor to end (default) |
| `1` | From beginning to cursor |
| `2` | Entire display/line |

## Description

Per the VT510 manual, DECSED and DECSEL function identically to ED and EL respectively, but only erase characters that were written **without** the protected attribute. Characters marked as protected (by DECSCA — Select Character Protection Attribute) are left intact.

The `?` prefix in the sequence distinguishes these from the standard ED (`CSI J`) and EL (`CSI K`).

This feature is used in forms-oriented applications where certain fields (labels, borders) should remain on screen while user-editable areas can be selectively cleared.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[1"q'      # DECSCA: mark subsequent chars as protected
printf 'Label: '
printf '\e[0"q'      # DECSCA: mark subsequent chars as erasable
printf 'user input'
printf '\e[?2J'      # DECSED: erase only unprotected characters
```
