**DECSLRM** (Set Left and Right Margins) is a CSI sequence that defines horizontal scrolling margins. It is only active when left/right margin mode (DECLRMM, mode 69) is enabled.

## Syntax

```
CSI Pl ; Pr s     DECSLRM — Set Left and Right Margins
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
DECSLRM = 0x1b, "[", [ Pl, [ ";", Pr ] ], "s" ;
Pl = digit, { digit } ;                 (* left margin, default: 1 *)
Pr = digit, { digit } ;                 (* right margin, default: screen width *)
digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4"
      | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
`} />

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `Pl` | Left margin column | 1 |
| `Pr` | Right margin column | Screen width |

## Description

Per the VT510 manual, DECSLRM sets the left and right margins of the scrolling region. `Pl` must be less than `Pr`. The sequence is only recognized when DECLRMM (mode 69) has been enabled via `CSI ? 69 h`.

When left/right margins are active, the following operations are confined horizontally:

- Character insertion and deletion (ICH, DCH)
- Erase operations respect the margins
- Cursor wrapping at end of line wraps within the margin area
- Scrolling operations are confined to the rectangular region defined by both vertical (DECSTBM) and horizontal (DECSLRM) margins

`CSI s` with no parameters resets the left and right margins to the full screen width.

### Conflict with SCP

`CSI s` is also used for SCP (Save Cursor Position). When DECLRMM (mode 69) is enabled, `CSI s` with parameters is interpreted as DECSLRM. Applications that need both left/right margins and cursor save should use DECSC/DECRC (`ESC 7` / `ESC 8`) instead of SCP/RCP.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[?69h'         # Enable left/right margin mode
printf '\e[5;40s'        # Set left margin to 5, right margin to 40
printf '\e[?69l'         # Disable left/right margin mode
```
