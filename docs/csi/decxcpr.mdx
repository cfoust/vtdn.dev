**DECXCPR** (Extended Cursor Position Report) is a DEC private variant of CPR that includes the current page number in the response.

## Syntax

```
CSI ? 6 n              DECXCPR request
CSI ? Pr ; Pc ; Pp R   DECXCPR response
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
(* Request *)
DECXCPR-request  = 0x1b, "[", "?", "6", "n" ;

(* Response *)
DECXCPR-response = 0x1b, "[", "?", Pr, ";", Pc, ";", Pp, "R" ;
Pr               = digit, { digit } ;              (* row *)
Pc               = digit, { digit } ;              (* column *)
Pp               = digit, { digit } ;              (* page, usually 1 *)
digit            = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4"
                 | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
`} />

### Response

The terminal responds with `CSI ? Pr ; Pc ; Pp R` where:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Pr` | Current cursor row (1-based) |
| `Pc` | Current cursor column (1-based) |
| `Pp` | Current page number (typically 1) |

## Description

Per the VT510 manual, DECXCPR is the DEC private version of the standard cursor position report. It is requested via `CSI ? 6 n` (a private-mode DSR) and differs from the standard CPR in two ways:

1. The response includes a `?` prefix: `CSI ? Pr ; Pc ; Pp R`
2. The response includes a third parameter for the page number

The page number parameter (`Pp`) is a legacy concept from multi-page DEC terminals. Modern terminals typically report page 1.

Since the response includes the `?` prefix, applications can distinguish DECXCPR responses from standard CPR responses. This is useful when both queries may be in flight.

DECXCPR was introduced on the VT330 and later terminals. XTerm supports it when the terminal ID is set to 330 or higher.

## Examples

```bash
# Request extended cursor position report
printf '\e[?6n'
# Response: ESC [ ? Pr ; Pc ; 1 R
```
