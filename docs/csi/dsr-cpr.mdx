<StatusBadges status={{ standard_track: true }} />

**DSR** (Device Status Report) and **CPR** (Active Position Report) are CSI sequences used to query the terminal's status and cursor position.

## Syntax

```
CSI Ps n       DSR — Device Status Report (request)
CSI Pn ; Pn R  CPR — Active Position Report (response)
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
(* Status query *)
DSR-status   = 0x1b, "[", "5", "n" ;

(* Cursor position query *)
DSR-position = 0x1b, "[", "6", "n" ;

(* Cursor position response *)
CPR          = 0x1b, "[", Pn, ";", Pn, "R" ;
Pn           = digit, { digit } ;
digit        = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4"
             | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
`} />

### Parameters (Request)

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `5` | Request device status |
| `6` | Request cursor position (CPR) |

### Response

**DSR 5 (Status Report):**

The terminal responds with `CSI 0 n` to indicate "ready, no malfunction detected." Per ECMA-48 §8.3.35, other status codes (1-4) indicate busy or malfunction states, but modern terminals always report status 0.

**DSR 6 (Cursor Position Report):**

The terminal responds with `CSI Pr ; Pc R` where `Pr` is the current row and `Pc` is the current column. Positions are 1-based. If DECOM (origin mode) is set, the reported row is relative to the top margin.

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.35, DSR is used either to report the status of the sending device or to request a status report from the receiving device. Parameter value 5 requests a general status report; parameter value 6 requests an Active Position Report (CPR).

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.14, CPR reports the active position as row and column numbers. The response is sent from terminal to host on the input stream.

DSR/CPR is one of the most fundamental query/response sequences and has been supported since the original VT100. Applications use it for terminal capability detection, screen size measurement, and synchronization.

## Examples

```bash
# Query device status (response: ESC [ 0 n)
printf '\e[5n'

# Query cursor position (response: ESC [ Pr ; Pc R)
printf '\e[6n'

# Read the CPR response
printf '\e[6n'; read -sdR response; echo "$response"
```
