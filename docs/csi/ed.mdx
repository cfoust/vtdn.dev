**ED** (Erase in Display / Erase in Page) is a CSI sequence that erases part or all of the visible screen.

## Syntax

```
CSI Ps J      ED — Erase in Display
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
ED = 0x1b, "[", [ Ps ], "J" ;
Ps = "0" | "1" | "2" ;                  (* default: 0 *)
`} />

### Parameters

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `0` | Erase from cursor to end of display (default) |
| `1` | Erase from start of display to cursor |
| `2` | Erase the entire display |

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.39, ED puts character positions into the erased state depending on the parameter value. "Erased state" means the positions are filled with the current background color (as set by SGR).

- **`CSI 0 J`** or **`CSI J`** — Erases from the cursor position (inclusive) through the end of the screen. The cursor position does not change.
- **`CSI 1 J`** — Erases from the beginning of the screen through the cursor position (inclusive). The cursor position does not change.
- **`CSI 2 J`** — Erases the entire visible screen. The cursor position does not change. The scrollback buffer is **not** affected.

:::note
`CSI 2 J` clears the screen but does not move the cursor. To clear the screen and move home, use `CSI 2 J` followed by `CSI H`. This pair is what the `clear` command typically sends.
:::

### DECSED

The selective erase variant `CSI ? Ps J` (DECSED) erases only characters that were **not** written with the "protected" attribute set by DECSCA. Most applications use the non-selective form.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[J'        # Erase from cursor to end of screen
printf '\e[1J'       # Erase from start of screen to cursor
printf '\e[2J'       # Erase entire screen
printf '\e[2J\e[H'   # Clear screen and move home
```
