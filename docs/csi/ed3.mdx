**ED 3** is an XTerm extension to the standard ED (Erase in Display) sequence that clears the scrollback buffer.

## Syntax

```
CSI 3 J       ED 3 — Erase scrollback buffer
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
ED3 = 0x1b, "[", "3", "J" ;
`} />

## Description

`CSI 3 J` erases the scrollback (history) buffer while leaving the visible screen contents intact. This is an extension beyond the standard ECMA-48 ED values of 0, 1, and 2.

Some terminals combine the effects: `CSI 3 J` clears only the scrollback, while `CSI 2 J` followed by `CSI 3 J` clears both the visible screen and the scrollback. Other implementations have `CSI 3 J` clear everything (both visible and scrollback).

This sequence is commonly used by the `clear -x` and `clear` commands (with appropriate terminfo entries) to reset the terminal's scroll history, for example to prevent sensitive information from remaining accessible by scrolling up.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[3J'             # Clear scrollback buffer
printf '\e[2J\e[3J\e[H'   # Clear screen + scrollback + home
```
