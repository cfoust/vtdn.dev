**EL** (Erase in Line) is a CSI sequence that erases part or all of the current line.

## Syntax

```
CSI Ps K      EL — Erase in Line
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
EL = 0x1b, "[", [ Ps ], "K" ;
Ps = "0" | "1" | "2" ;                  (* default: 0 *)
`} />

### Parameters

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `0` | Erase from cursor to end of line (default) |
| `1` | Erase from start of line to cursor |
| `2` | Erase the entire line |

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.41, EL puts character positions on the active line into the erased state depending on the parameter value. The cursor position does not change for any variant.

- **`CSI 0 K`** or **`CSI K`** — Erases from the cursor position (inclusive) through the end of the line.
- **`CSI 1 K`** — Erases from the beginning of the line through the cursor position (inclusive).
- **`CSI 2 K`** — Erases the entire line.

"Erased state" means the positions are filled with the current background color (as set by SGR).

### DECSEL

The selective erase variant `CSI ? Ps K` (DECSEL) erases only characters not written with the "protected" attribute. Most applications use the non-selective form.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[K'        # Erase from cursor to end of line
printf '\e[1K'       # Erase from start of line to cursor
printf '\e[2K'       # Erase entire line
```
