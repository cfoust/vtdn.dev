**ICH** (Insert Character), **DCH** (Delete Character), and **ECH** (Erase Character) are CSI sequences that insert, delete, or erase characters at the cursor position within the current line.

## Syntax

```
CSI Pn @      ICH — Insert Character
CSI Pn P      DCH — Delete Character
CSI Pn X      ECH — Erase Character
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
ICH = 0x1b, "[", [ Pn ], "@" ;
DCH = 0x1b, "[", [ Pn ], "P" ;
ECH = 0x1b, "[", [ Pn ], "X" ;
Pn  = digit, { digit } ;                (* default: 1 *)
digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4"
      | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
`} />

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `Pn` | Number of characters to insert/delete/erase | 1 |

## Description

These three operations affect characters on the current line only. They do not cross line boundaries.

### ICH — Insert Character (CSI Pn @)

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.64, ICH inserts `Pn` blank characters at the cursor position. Existing characters from the cursor rightward are shifted to the right; characters pushed past the right margin are lost. The cursor position does not change.

### DCH — Delete Character (CSI Pn P)

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.26, DCH removes `Pn` characters starting at the cursor position. Characters to the right are shifted left to fill the gap, and blank characters are inserted at the right end of the line.

### ECH — Erase Character (CSI Pn X)

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.38, ECH replaces `Pn` characters starting at the cursor position with blank (erased) characters. Unlike DCH, no shifting occurs — surrounding characters are not moved. The cursor position does not change.

:::note
The key distinction: ICH and DCH **shift** characters on the line (insert/delete semantics), while ECH **overwrites** characters in place (erase semantics).

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[2@'       # Insert 2 blank characters at cursor
printf '\e[3P'       # Delete 3 characters at cursor
printf '\e[5X'       # Erase 5 characters at cursor (no shift)
```
