<StatusBadges status={{ standard_track: true }} />

**IL** (Insert Line) and **DL** (Delete Line) are CSI sequences that insert or delete lines at the cursor's current row within the scrolling region.

## Syntax

```
CSI Pn L      IL — Insert Line
CSI Pn M      DL — Delete Line
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
IL = 0x1b, "[", [ Pn ], "L" ;
DL = 0x1b, "[", [ Pn ], "M" ;
Pn = digit, { digit } ;                 (* default: 1 *)
digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4"
      | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
`} />

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `Pn` | Number of lines to insert or delete | 1 |

## Description

### IL — Insert Line (CSI Pn L)

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.67, IL inserts `Pn` blank lines at the cursor's row. The current line and the lines below it within the scrolling region are shifted down. Lines pushed past the bottom margin of the scrolling region are lost. The cursor moves to column 1 of the current row.

### DL — Delete Line (CSI Pn M)

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.32, DL removes `Pn` lines starting at the cursor's row. Lines below the deleted range within the scrolling region are shifted up, and blank lines are added at the bottom margin. The cursor moves to column 1 of the current row.

Both operations are confined to the scrolling region set by DECSTBM. Lines outside the scrolling region are not affected.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[2L'       # Insert 2 blank lines at cursor row
printf '\e[3M'       # Delete 3 lines starting at cursor row
```
