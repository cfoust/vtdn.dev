**REP** (Repeat) is a CSI sequence that repeats the preceding graphic character a specified number of times.

## Syntax

```
CSI Pn b      REP — Repeat preceding character
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
REP = 0x1b, "[", [ Pn ], "b" ;
Pn  = digit, { digit } ;                (* default: 1 *)
digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4"
      | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
`} />

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `Pn` | Number of times to repeat | 1 |

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.103, REP causes the preceding graphic character (including SPACE) to be repeated `Pn` times. The character is printed at the current cursor position and the cursor advances normally as if the character had been typed that many times.

If the preceding data-stream element is a control function rather than a graphic character, the effect of REP is not defined by the standard. In practice, most terminals ignore REP in that case.

REP is useful for run-length compression of repeated characters in the output stream, reducing bandwidth when sending large blocks of identical characters (e.g., filling a line with dashes or spaces).

## Examples

```bash
printf 'A\e[4b'     # Print "A" then repeat it 4 times → "AAAAA"
printf '-\e[79b'     # Print 80 dashes (1 + 79 repeats)
```
