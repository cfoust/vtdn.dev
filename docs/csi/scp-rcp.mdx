**SCP** (Save Cursor Position) and **RCP** (Restore Cursor Position) are CSI sequences originating from ANSI.SYS that save and restore the cursor position.

## Syntax

```
CSI s         SCP — Save Cursor Position
CSI u         RCP — Restore Cursor Position
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
SCP = 0x1b, "[", "s" ;
RCP = 0x1b, "[", "u" ;
`} />

## Description

- **SCP** (`CSI s`) — Saves the current cursor position (row and column).
- **RCP** (`CSI u`) — Restores the cursor to the position previously saved by SCP.

These sequences originated in MS-DOS ANSI.SYS and save only the cursor position — not character attributes, character sets, or other terminal state. This is in contrast to DECSC/DECRC (`ESC 7` / `ESC 8`), which saves a more complete snapshot of terminal state.

### Conflict with DECSLRM

`CSI s` is also used for DECSLRM (Set Left and Right Margins) when left/right margin mode (DECLRMM, mode 69) is enabled. When DECLRMM is set, `CSI s` with parameters sets the left and right margins rather than saving the cursor. The parameterless form `CSI s` (no arguments) can be ambiguous in this context, so applications needing both left/right margins and cursor save/restore should use DECSC/DECRC instead.

:::note
Because DECSC/DECRC saves more state and avoids the DECSLRM conflict, it is generally preferred over SCP/RCP. SCP/RCP remains widely supported for compatibility with ANSI.SYS-era software.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[s'            # Save cursor position
printf '\e[10;20H'       # Move cursor elsewhere
printf 'Hello'
printf '\e[u'            # Restore cursor to saved position
```
