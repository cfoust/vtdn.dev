<StatusBadges status={{ standard_track: true }} />

**SU** (Scroll Up) and **SD** (Scroll Down) are CSI sequences that scroll the contents of the scrolling region without moving the cursor.

## Syntax

```
CSI Pn S      SU — Scroll Up
CSI Pn T      SD — Scroll Down
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
SU = 0x1b, "[", [ Pn ], "S" ;
SD = 0x1b, "[", [ Pn ], "T" ;
Pn = digit, { digit } ;                 (* default: 1 *)
digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4"
      | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
`} />

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `Pn` | Number of lines to scroll | 1 |

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.147 (SU) and §8.3.113 (SD):

- **SU** (`CSI Pn S`) — Scrolls the content of the scrolling region up by `Pn` lines. New blank lines appear at the bottom of the scrolling region. Lines scrolled off the top may be added to the scrollback buffer.
- **SD** (`CSI Pn T`) — Scrolls the content of the scrolling region down by `Pn` lines. New blank lines appear at the top of the scrolling region. Lines scrolled off the bottom are lost.

The cursor position is **not** changed by either operation. Only the content within the scrolling region (set by DECSTBM) is affected.

:::note
`CSI T` with more than one parameter is interpreted as mouse tracking (Highlight Mouse Tracking) rather than SD on some terminals. The single-parameter form is safe.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[5S'       # Scroll up 5 lines
printf '\e[3T'       # Scroll down 3 lines
```
