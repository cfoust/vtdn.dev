**XTVERSION** is an XTerm extension that queries the terminal for its name and version string. The request is a CSI sequence, but the response is a DCS string, making this a hybrid sequence that spans both CSI and DCS categories.

## Syntax

```
CSI > 0 q            XTVERSION request
DCS > | text ST      XTVERSION response
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
(* Request *)
XTVERSION-request  = 0x1b, "[", ">", [ "0" ], "q" ;

(* Response *)
XTVERSION-response = 0x1b, "P", ">", "|", text, 0x1b, "\\\\" ;
text = printable-char, { printable-char } ;
printable-char = ? any printable ASCII character (0x20..0x7E) ? ;
`} />

### Response

The terminal responds with a DCS string containing a free-form text identifier. The format varies by terminal:

| Terminal | Example response |
|----------|-----------------|
| XTerm | `DCS > \| XTerm(370) ST` |
| foot | `DCS > \| foot(1.16.2) ST` |
| Kitty | `DCS > \| kitty(0.26.5) ST` |
| WezTerm | `DCS > \| WezTerm 20240203-110809-5046fc22 ST` |
| tmux | `DCS > \| tmux 3.4 ST` |
| Contour | `DCS > \| contour(0.4.3.6456) ST` |

## Description

XTVERSION provides a straightforward way for applications to identify which terminal emulator (and version) they are running under. Unlike DA1 and DA2, which report VT-level compatibility codes, XTVERSION returns a human-readable name and version string.

The request `CSI > q` (or equivalently `CSI > 0 q`) was introduced in XTerm patch 230. Despite the request being a CSI sequence, the response uses a DCS envelope (`DCS > | ... ST`), which is unusual among terminal query/response pairs.

### Comparison with DA2

DA2 (`CSI > c`) also provides terminal identification, but it uses numeric codes that require a lookup table to interpret. XTVERSION provides the terminal name directly as text, making it simpler for scripts and applications to parse.

### Use cases

- **Feature detection**: Identify the terminal to enable or disable features known to work (or not work) in specific terminals or versions.
- **Bug workarounds**: Apply version-specific workarounds by parsing the version number from the response.
- **Diagnostics**: Log or display the terminal identity for debugging purposes.

### Caveats

Not all terminals implement XTVERSION. Applications should use a timeout when waiting for the response, as terminals that do not recognize the sequence will simply not reply. Running inside a multiplexer like tmux may also affect the response -- tmux responds with its own identity rather than forwarding the query to the outer terminal.

## Examples

```bash
# Query terminal version
printf '\e[>q'

# Query with explicit zero parameter
printf '\e[>0q'

# Read the response (in a script)
# The response arrives as: ESC P > | <name>(<version>) ESC \
```
