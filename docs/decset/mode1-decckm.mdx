**DECCKM** (Mode 1) is a DECSET/DECRST mode that controls whether the cursor keys send normal (ANSI) sequences or application (SS3) sequences.

## Syntax

```
CSI ? 1 h    DECSET — Enable application cursor keys
CSI ? 1 l    DECRST — Disable application cursor keys (normal mode)
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
DECSET-mode1 = 0x1b, "[", "?", "1", "h" ;
DECRST-mode1 = 0x1b, "[", "?", "1", "l" ;
`} />

## Description

Per the VT100 User Guide and VT510 Programmer Reference, DECCKM controls the sequences generated by the four cursor (arrow) keys.

- **Set (application mode)** — The cursor keys send SS3 sequences: `ESC O A` (Up), `ESC O B` (Down), `ESC O C` (Right), `ESC O D` (Left).
- **Reset (normal mode)** — The cursor keys send CSI sequences: `CSI A` (Up), `CSI B` (Down), `CSI C` (Right), `CSI D` (Left). This is the default.

### Cursor key output

| Key   | Normal (DECRST) | Application (DECSET) |
|-------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Up    | `ESC [ A`       | `ESC O A`            |
| Down  | `ESC [ B`       | `ESC O B`            |
| Right | `ESC [ C`       | `ESC O C`            |
| Left  | `ESC [ D`       | `ESC O D`            |

Application cursor key mode is typically enabled by full-screen terminal applications (such as `vi`, `less`, or `top`) via the `smkx`/`rmkx` terminfo capabilities, so that the application can distinguish arrow keys from other input that happens to include `CSI` sequences.

:::note
DECCKM only affects the four arrow keys. The numeric keypad has its own mode controlled by DECKPAM/DECKPNM (`ESC =` / `ESC >`).

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[?1h'      # Enable application cursor keys
printf '\e[?1l'      # Disable application cursor keys (normal mode)

# In application mode, pressing Up sends: ESC O A
# In normal mode, pressing Up sends:      ESC [ A
```
