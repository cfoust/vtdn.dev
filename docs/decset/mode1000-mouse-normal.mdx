**Normal Mouse Tracking** (Mode 1000) is a DECSET/DECRST mode that enables reporting of mouse button press and release events to the application.

## Syntax

```
CSI ? 1000 h    DECSET — Enable normal mouse tracking
CSI ? 1000 l    DECRST — Disable normal mouse tracking
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
DECSET-mode1000 = 0x1b, "[", "?", "1", "0", "0", "0", "h" ;
DECRST-mode1000 = 0x1b, "[", "?", "1", "0", "0", "0", "l" ;
`} />

## Description

Mode 1000 is an XTerm extension that enables basic mouse event reporting. When enabled, the terminal sends escape sequences to the application whenever a mouse button is pressed or released within the terminal window.

- **Set** — The terminal reports mouse button press and release events.
- **Reset** — Mouse events are not reported. The terminal handles mouse events normally (e.g., for text selection). This is the default.

### Report format (X10 encoding)

When a mouse event occurs, the terminal sends:

```
CSI M Cb Cx Cy
```

Where:
- `Cb` is the button byte: the button number plus modifier flags, plus 32
- `Cx` is the column (x coordinate) plus 32
- `Cy` is the row (y coordinate) plus 32

The 32 offset ensures all values are printable ASCII characters (space and above).

### Button encoding

| Value (Cb - 32) | Meaning |
|------------------|---------|
| `0`              | Left button press |
| `1`              | Middle button press |
| `2`              | Right button press |
| `3`              | Button release (any button) |
| `64`             | Scroll wheel up |
| `65`             | Scroll wheel down |

Modifier keys are encoded as additional bit flags:

| Bit  | Modifier |
|------|----------|
| `4`  | Shift    |
| `8`  | Meta/Alt |
| `16` | Control  |

### Limitations

The X10/normal encoding has a fundamental limitation: because coordinates are encoded as single bytes with a +32 offset, the maximum reportable position is column/row 223 (255 - 32). For terminals wider or taller than 223, the SGR mouse encoding (Mode 1006) should be used instead.

:::note
Mode 1000 reports press and release events but does **not** report mouse motion. For motion tracking, use Mode 1002 (button-event tracking) or Mode 1003 (any-event tracking).

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[?1000h'   # Enable normal mouse tracking
printf '\e[?1000l'   # Disable normal mouse tracking

# Typically combined with SGR encoding for better compatibility:
printf '\e[?1000h\e[?1006h'   # Enable mouse tracking with SGR encoding
printf '\e[?1006l\e[?1000l'   # Disable both (reverse order)
```
