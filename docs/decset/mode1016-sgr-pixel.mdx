**SGR-Pixel Mouse** (Mode 1016) is a DECSET/DECRST mode that modifies SGR mouse encoding to report pixel coordinates instead of cell coordinates.

## Syntax

```
CSI ? 1016 h    DECSET — Enable SGR-Pixel mouse encoding
CSI ? 1016 l    DECRST — Disable SGR-Pixel mouse encoding
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
DECSET-mode1016 = 0x1b, "[", "?", "1", "0", "1", "6", "h" ;
DECRST-mode1016 = 0x1b, "[", "?", "1", "0", "1", "6", "l" ;
`} />

## Description

Mode 1016 is an extension that builds on SGR mouse encoding (Mode 1006) by reporting mouse positions as pixel coordinates rather than cell (row/column) coordinates. This provides sub-cell precision for mouse events.

- **Set** — Mouse events report pixel coordinates.
- **Reset** — Mouse events report cell coordinates (standard SGR behavior). This is the default.

### Report format

The report format is identical to SGR mouse encoding, but the coordinate values represent pixels instead of cells:

```
CSI < Cb ; Px ; Py M    (button press or motion)
CSI < Cb ; Px ; Py m    (button release)
```

Where:
- `Cb` is the button number plus modifier flags (same encoding as Mode 1006)
- `Px` is the x coordinate in pixels (1-based, measured from the left edge of the terminal)
- `Py` is the y coordinate in pixels (1-based, measured from the top edge of the terminal)

### Requirements

Mode 1016 must be used in combination with:
1. A mouse tracking mode (Mode 1000, 1002, or 1003) to enable mouse event reporting
2. SGR encoding (Mode 1006), as Mode 1016 extends the SGR format

### Use cases

Pixel-level coordinates are valuable for:
- **GUI-like interfaces** that need sub-cell positioning precision
- **Image protocol interactions** where click targets are positioned at pixel boundaries, not cell boundaries
- **Custom widget rendering** where elements may not align to the cell grid
- **Sixel or Kitty graphics** where the application needs to know exactly which pixel was clicked

### Converting between pixel and cell coordinates

Applications can derive cell coordinates from pixel coordinates if they know the cell dimensions. The cell dimensions can be queried using the `CSI 14 t` (report window size in pixels) and `CSI 18 t` (report terminal size in characters) window operations.

## Examples

```bash
# Enable mouse tracking with SGR-Pixel encoding:
printf '\e[?1000h\e[?1006h\e[?1016h'

# A click at pixel position (150, 80) produces:
#   press:   \e[<0;150;80M
#   release: \e[<0;150;80m

# Disable (reverse order):
printf '\e[?1016l\e[?1006l\e[?1000l'
```
