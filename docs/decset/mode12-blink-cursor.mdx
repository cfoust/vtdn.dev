**Blink Cursor** (Mode 12) is a DECSET/DECRST mode that controls whether the text cursor blinks.

## Syntax

```
CSI ? 12 h    DECSET — Enable cursor blinking
CSI ? 12 l    DECRST — Disable cursor blinking (steady cursor)
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
DECSET-mode12 = 0x1b, "[", "?", "1", "2", "h" ;
DECRST-mode12 = 0x1b, "[", "?", "1", "2", "l" ;
`} />

## Description

Mode 12 originates from the AT&T 610 terminal (att610) and was adopted by XTerm as a way to toggle cursor blinking.

- **Set** — The cursor blinks at a rate determined by the terminal.
- **Reset** — The cursor is steady (does not blink). This is the default in many terminals.

### Relationship to DECSCUSR

Mode 12 provides a simple on/off toggle for cursor blinking. The DECSCUSR (Set Cursor Style) sequence `CSI Ps SP q` offers more fine-grained control, allowing the application to set both the cursor shape (block, underline, bar) and the blink state simultaneously.

When both Mode 12 and DECSCUSR are used, the most recently issued command typically takes precedence, though this behavior varies across terminals.

| DECSCUSR Value | Shape     | Blink   |
|----------------|-----------|---------|
| `0` or `1`     | Block     | Blink   |
| `2`            | Block     | Steady  |
| `3`            | Underline | Blink   |
| `4`            | Underline | Steady  |
| `5`            | Bar       | Blink   |
| `6`            | Bar       | Steady  |

:::note
The blink rate is not standardized and varies between terminal emulators, typically ranging from 500ms to 1000ms per cycle.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[?12h'     # Enable cursor blinking
printf '\e[?12l'     # Disable cursor blinking (steady)
```
