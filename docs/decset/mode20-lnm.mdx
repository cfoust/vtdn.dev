**LNM** (Mode 20) is an ANSI mode that controls whether line feed characters (LF, VT, FF) also perform a carriage return, moving the cursor to the first column.

## Syntax

```
CSI 20 h    Set — Enable newline mode (LF implies CR)
CSI 20 l    Reset — Disable newline mode (LF only moves down)
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
set-LNM   = 0x1b, "[", "2", "0", "h" ;
reset-LNM = 0x1b, "[", "2", "0", "l" ;
`} />

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §7.2.12, LNM (Line Feed/New Line Mode) controls the interpretation of the line feed function.

- **Set (newline mode)** — When a LF (0x0A), VT (0x0B), or FF (0x0C) character is received, the cursor moves down one line **and** returns to the first column (as if a CR were also performed). Additionally, when the Return key is pressed, the terminal sends CR LF instead of just CR.
- **Reset (line feed mode)** — LF, VT, and FF only move the cursor down one line without changing the column position. The Return key sends only CR. This is the default.

:::note
LNM is an **ANSI standard mode**, not a DEC private mode. It uses `CSI 20 h` / `CSI 20 l` (without the `?` prefix). This distinguishes it from DEC private modes which use the `CSI ?` prefix.
:::

### Bidirectional effect

LNM affects both directions of communication:
- **Host to terminal** — Controls whether received LF/VT/FF characters also imply CR
- **Terminal to host** — Controls whether the Return key sends CR alone or CR+LF

This bidirectional nature means that toggling LNM changes the behavior of both displayed output and keyboard input.

:::caution
LNM was removed from ECMA-48 in the 5th edition (1991) because it was considered a host responsibility rather than a terminal function. Despite this, it remains widely supported by terminal emulators for backward compatibility.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[20h'      # Enable newline mode (LF implies CR)
printf '\e[20l'      # Disable newline mode (LF only moves down)
```
