**DECTCEM** (Mode 25) is a DECSET/DECRST mode that controls whether the text cursor is visible on screen.

## Syntax

```
CSI ? 25 h    DECSET — Show cursor
CSI ? 25 l    DECRST — Hide cursor
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
DECSET-mode25 = 0x1b, "[", "?", "2", "5", "h" ;
DECRST-mode25 = 0x1b, "[", "?", "2", "5", "l" ;
`} />

## Description

Per the VT220 Programmer Reference and VT510 Programmer Reference, DECTCEM (Text Cursor Enable Mode) controls the visibility of the text cursor.

- **Set** — The cursor is visible. This is the default.
- **Reset** — The cursor is hidden. The cursor position is still tracked internally and all positioning sequences continue to work; the cursor is simply not rendered on screen.

### Common uses

Hiding the cursor is one of the most commonly used DECSET modes. Applications hide the cursor to:

- Prevent the cursor from flickering during screen updates
- Create a cleaner visual display for status bars, menus, or animations
- Avoid distracting cursor artifacts when drawing full-screen interfaces

Well-behaved applications should always restore cursor visibility (DECSET mode 25) before exiting. Many terminal multiplexers and shell prompts reset this mode to ensure the cursor is visible.

:::note
DECTCEM only controls whether the cursor is drawn. It does not affect the cursor position, which continues to be tracked. Sequences like CUP and DSR/CPR still work correctly when the cursor is hidden.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[?25l'     # Hide the cursor
printf '\e[?25h'     # Show the cursor

# Hide cursor during a screen update
printf '\e[?25l'     # Hide cursor
printf '\e[2J\e[H'   # Clear screen and move home
# ... draw the interface ...
printf '\e[?25h'     # Show cursor when done
```
