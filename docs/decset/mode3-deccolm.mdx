**DECCOLM** (Mode 3) is a DECSET/DECRST mode that switches the terminal between 132-column and 80-column display widths.

## Syntax

```
CSI ? 3 h    DECSET — Switch to 132 columns
CSI ? 3 l    DECRST — Switch to 80 columns
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
DECSET-mode3 = 0x1b, "[", "?", "3", "h" ;
DECRST-mode3 = 0x1b, "[", "?", "3", "l" ;
`} />

## Description

Per the VT100 User Guide and VT510 Programmer Reference, DECCOLM controls the number of columns displayed on the screen.

- **Set** — The terminal switches to 132 columns per line.
- **Reset** — The terminal switches to 80 columns per line. This is the default.

### Side effects

Toggling DECCOLM has significant side effects:

- The screen is cleared (equivalent to ED 2)
- The cursor moves to the home position (row 1, column 1)
- The scrolling margins (DECSTBM) are reset to the full screen
- If DECOM (origin mode) is set, the cursor moves to the home position within the scrolling region

These side effects occur on both set and reset transitions, making DECCOLM a common way to perform a "soft reset" of the display in legacy applications.

:::note
Many modern terminal emulators allow the window to be resized freely and may ignore or restrict DECCOLM. XTerm requires the `allowColumnMode` resource to be enabled for DECCOLM to function. In terminals that support it, the actual column count may be adjusted by resizing the window rather than changing the font.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[?3h'      # Switch to 132-column mode
printf '\e[?3l'      # Switch to 80-column mode

# Note: both commands clear the screen as a side effect
```
