**Reverse Wrap** (Mode 45) is a DECSET/DECRST mode that controls whether a backspace at the beginning of a line wraps the cursor to the end of the previous line.

## Syntax

```
CSI ? 45 h    DECSET — Enable reverse wraparound
CSI ? 45 l    DECRST — Disable reverse wraparound
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
DECSET-mode45 = 0x1b, "[", "?", "4", "5", "h" ;
DECRST-mode45 = 0x1b, "[", "?", "4", "5", "l" ;
`} />

## Description

Mode 45 is an XTerm extension that enables reverse wraparound. When a backspace (BS, 0x08) is received while the cursor is at the first column, this mode controls whether the cursor wraps to the last column of the previous line.

- **Set (reverse wrap on)** — A backspace at column 1 moves the cursor to the last column of the previous line. If the cursor is at the top-left corner of the screen (or scrolling region), the backspace has no effect.
- **Reset (reverse wrap off)** — A backspace at column 1 has no effect; the cursor stays at column 1. This is the default.

### Requirements

Reverse wrap only occurs when **both** of the following conditions are met:

1. Mode 45 (reverse wraparound) is enabled
2. DECAWM (Mode 7, auto-wrap) is also enabled

If auto-wrap is disabled, reverse wrap has no effect regardless of Mode 45.

### Scope

Reverse wrap only applies to the BS (backspace) control character. Cursor movement sequences like CUB (`CSI D`) do not wrap regardless of this mode; they stop at column 1.

:::note
XTerm also supports Mode 1045, which is a variant that interacts differently with the alternate screen buffer. Mode 45 is the more commonly implemented variant.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[?7h'      # Enable auto-wrap (required for reverse wrap)
printf '\e[?45h'     # Enable reverse wraparound
printf '\e[?45l'     # Disable reverse wraparound
```
