**DECLRMM** (Mode 69) is a DECSET/DECRST mode that enables or disables left and right margins, allowing DECSLRM to define a horizontal scrolling region.

## Syntax

```
CSI ? 69 h    DECSET — Enable left/right margin mode
CSI ? 69 l    DECRST — Disable left/right margin mode
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
DECSET-mode69 = 0x1b, "[", "?", "6", "9", "h" ;
DECRST-mode69 = 0x1b, "[", "?", "6", "9", "l" ;
`} />

## Description

Per the VT420 and VT510 Programmer Reference manuals, DECLRMM (Left Right Margin Mode) controls whether the terminal recognizes left and right margins set by DECSLRM.

- **Set** — Left and right margins are enabled. DECSLRM (`CSI Pl ; Pr s`) can be used to define the left and right margin columns. Printing, scrolling, and cursor movement are constrained within these margins.
- **Reset** — Left and right margins are disabled. The left margin is fixed at column 1 and the right margin is fixed at the last column. This is the default.

### Side effects

When DECLRMM is reset, any previously set left and right margins are cleared. The margins revert to the full width of the screen.

### Interaction with other features

When left/right margins are active:

- **Printing** — Characters that reach the right margin wrap to the left margin of the next line (if DECAWM is set), rather than to column 1.
- **Scrolling** — IL, DL, SU, SD, and other scroll operations only affect the region within the left and right margins.
- **Cursor movement** — CUB stops at the left margin; CUF stops at the right margin. CUP coordinates are relative to the margins when DECOM is set.
- **Erasure** — EL erases within the full line width, but ICH, DCH, and ECH operate within the margins.

:::note
DECLRMM must be enabled before DECSLRM can set margins. If DECLRMM is off, the `CSI Pl ; Pr s` sequence is interpreted as SCP (Save Cursor Position) instead. This ambiguity between DECSLRM and SCP is a well-known source of compatibility issues.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[?69h'         # Enable left/right margin mode
printf '\e[10;70s'       # Set left margin to column 10, right margin to column 70
# Text and scrolling are now confined to columns 10-70

printf '\e[?69l'         # Disable left/right margin mode (margins cleared)
```
