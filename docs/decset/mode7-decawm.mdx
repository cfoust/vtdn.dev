**DECAWM** (Mode 7) is a DECSET/DECRST mode that controls whether characters written past the right margin automatically wrap to the beginning of the next line.

## Syntax

```
CSI ? 7 h    DECSET — Enable auto-wrap
CSI ? 7 l    DECRST — Disable auto-wrap
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
DECSET-mode7 = 0x1b, "[", "?", "7", "h" ;
DECRST-mode7 = 0x1b, "[", "?", "7", "l" ;
`} />

## Description

Per the VT100 User Guide and VT510 Programmer Reference, DECAWM controls the behavior when a character is written to the last column of the current line.

- **Set (auto-wrap on)** — When a character is received while the cursor is at the right margin, the cursor wraps to the first column of the next line. If the cursor is on the bottom line of the scrolling region, the screen scrolls up by one line. This is the default on most modern terminals.
- **Reset (auto-wrap off)** — When a character is received while the cursor is at the right margin, subsequent characters overwrite the last column position. The cursor does not advance to the next line.

### Deferred wrap (pending wrap state)

Most terminals implement a "deferred" or "pending" wrap mechanism. When a character is printed in the last column, the cursor does not immediately move to the next line. Instead, the terminal enters a "pending wrap" state. The wrap occurs only when the next printable character is received. This allows the last column to be written without triggering an unwanted blank line.

This subtle behavior means that after writing to the last column:
- A cursor movement sequence (CUP, CUF, etc.) clears the pending wrap state without wrapping
- The next printable character triggers the wrap and is placed in column 1 of the next line

:::note
DECAWM is saved and restored by DECSC/DECRC (`ESC 7` / `ESC 8`).

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[?7h'      # Enable auto-wrap (default on most terminals)
printf '\e[?7l'      # Disable auto-wrap

# With auto-wrap disabled, overwrite the last column repeatedly
printf '\e[?7l'
printf '\e[1;80H'    # Move to last column
printf 'ABCDE'       # Only 'E' is visible in the last column
printf '\e[?7h'      # Re-enable auto-wrap
```
