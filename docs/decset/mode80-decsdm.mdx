**DECSDM** (Mode 80) is a DECSET/DECRST mode that controls whether sixel graphics are displayed in scrolling mode or at a fixed screen position.

## Syntax

```
CSI ? 80 h    DECSET — Disable sixel scrolling (fixed position)
CSI ? 80 l    DECRST — Enable sixel scrolling
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
DECSET-mode80 = 0x1b, "[", "?", "8", "0", "h" ;
DECRST-mode80 = 0x1b, "[", "?", "8", "0", "l" ;
`} />

## Description

Per the VT330/VT340 Programmer Reference, DECSDM (Sixel Display Mode) controls how sixel graphics data is positioned on the screen.

- **Set (sixel scrolling disabled)** — Sixel graphics are drawn at a fixed position on the screen, starting at the upper-left corner of the display. The cursor position is not used and does not change. The sixel image overwrites whatever is at the fixed location.
- **Reset (sixel scrolling enabled)** — Sixel graphics are drawn starting at the current cursor position. After the sixel data is complete, the cursor advances to the line below the image. If the image extends beyond the bottom of the scrolling region, the screen scrolls to accommodate it. This is the default.

:::caution
The sense of this mode is inverted from what many expect: **set** (h) *disables* scrolling, and **reset** (l) *enables* scrolling. This is because the original DEC hardware defaulted to the scrolling behavior and the mode was added to allow the older fixed-position behavior.
:::

### Sixel scrolling behavior

When sixel scrolling is enabled (mode reset, the default):

1. The sixel image begins rendering at the current cursor position
2. Each sixel row (6 pixels tall) advances the cursor down by one character cell
3. If the image reaches the bottom margin, the screen scrolls
4. After the image is complete, the cursor is positioned on the line immediately below the image

When sixel scrolling is disabled (mode set):

1. The sixel image is rendered at the upper-left corner of the screen
2. The cursor position is not affected
3. No scrolling occurs

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[?80l'     # Enable sixel scrolling (default)
printf '\e[?80h'     # Disable sixel scrolling (fixed position)
```
