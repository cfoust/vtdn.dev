**DECSC** (Save Cursor) and **DECRC** (Restore Cursor) are DEC VT100 escape sequences that save and restore the cursor position along with associated terminal state.

## Syntax

```
ESC 7         DECSC — Save cursor
ESC 8         DECRC — Restore cursor
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
DECSC = 0x1b, "7" ;
DECRC = 0x1b, "8" ;
`} />

## Description

### DECSC — Save cursor (ESC 7)

Per the VT510 manual, DECSC saves the following state:

- Cursor position (row and column)
- Character attributes (set by SGR)
- Character sets designated in GL and GR (G0, G1, G2, G3)
- Autowrap mode (DECAWM) state
- Origin mode (DECOM) state
- Selective erase attribute
- Any pending single-shift (SS2/SS3) state

### DECRC — Restore cursor (ESC 8)

DECRC restores the state previously saved by DECSC. If DECSC has not been issued since the terminal was powered on or reset, DECRC applies these defaults:

- Cursor moves to the home position (row 1, column 1)
- Origin mode is reset
- All character attributes are turned off
- ASCII is mapped into GL, DEC Supplemental Graphic into GR

### Save buffer

The terminal maintains a single save buffer. Calling DECSC again overwrites the previously saved state. The main screen and alternate screen each have their own independent save buffer.

:::note
The ANSI equivalent is SCP/RCP (`CSI s` / `CSI u`), but DECSC/DECRC saves more state. Many applications prefer DECSC/DECRC for this reason.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e7'          # Save cursor position and state
printf '\e[10;20H'    # Move cursor elsewhere
printf 'Hello'        # Write some text
printf '\e8'          # Restore cursor to saved position
```
