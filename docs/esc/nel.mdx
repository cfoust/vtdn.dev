**NEL** (Next Line) is a C1 control function that moves the cursor to the first position of the next line, effectively combining a carriage return and a line feed into a single operation.

## Syntax

```
ESC E         NEL — Next Line (7-bit)
0x85          NEL — Next Line (8-bit C1)
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
NEL = ( 0x1b, "E" ) | 0x85 ;
`} />

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.86, NEL "causes the active presentation position to be moved to the line home position of the following line in the presentation component." In standard terminal usage, this means column 1 of the next line.

If the cursor is at the bottom of the scrolling region (set by DECSTBM), the display scrolls up before the cursor moves to the first column of the (now blank) bottom line.

NEL is functionally equivalent to CR+LF, but as a single C1 control it is atomic — there is no intermediate state where the cursor is at column 1 of the current line.

## Examples

```bash
printf 'Line 1\eELine 2'    # "Line 1" then "Line 2" starting at column 1
```
