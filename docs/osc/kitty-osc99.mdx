**Kitty OSC 99** is a desktop notification protocol that supports rich notifications with titles, bodies, buttons, and other metadata. It supersedes simpler notification mechanisms like OSC 9 and OSC 777 by providing structured key-value parameters.

## Syntax

```
OSC 99 ; key=value ; key=value ST                Simple notification
OSC 99 ; d=0 ; key=value ; key=value ST          Start of multi-part notification
OSC 99 ; d=1 ; key=value ST                      Continuation payload
OSC 99 ; d=2 ; key=value ST                      End of multi-part notification
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
OSC99       = 0x1b, "]", "99", ";", param, { ";", param }, ( 0x07 | 0x1b, "\\\\" ) ;
param       = key, "=", value ;
key         = letter, { letter | digit | "_" } ;
value       = { printable-char } ;
letter      = "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i" | "j"
            | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t"
            | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z"
            | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" | "I" | "J"
            | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T"
            | "U" | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z" ;
digit       = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
`} />

### Parameters

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `d` | Delivery mode: absent or omitted for a complete notification; `0` to start a multi-part notification; `1` for continuation; `2` for the final part. |
| `p` | Payload type: `title` or `body`. Determines which field the text in this part applies to. |
| `i` | Notification identifier (string). Used to update or close an existing notification. |
| `e` | Event handling: `0` (default) for no callback, `1` to report when the notification is activated or closed. |
| `o` | Urgency/type: `always` to show even if the window is focused, `unfocused` (default) to show only when the terminal is not focused, `never` to suppress. |
| `a` | Action: `focus` to focus the terminal window when the notification is activated. |
| `f` | Flags for close behavior and other options. |

### Payload

The notification body text follows the last `;` separator. For simple notifications, it appears directly in the sequence. For multi-part notifications, the text is split across multiple OSC 99 sequences using the `d` parameter to indicate continuation.

## Description

The kitty notification protocol provides a structured way for terminal applications to send desktop notifications. It was designed to replace the ad-hoc OSC 9 and OSC 777 notification sequences with a more capable and well-defined protocol.

Key features of the protocol:

- **Multi-part payloads** -- Long notification bodies can be split across multiple escape sequences, avoiding terminal input buffer limits.
- **Notification identifiers** -- Each notification can have an `i` identifier, allowing the application to update the notification text or close it programmatically.
- **Event callbacks** -- When `e=1` is set, the terminal reports back to the application when the user interacts with or dismisses the notification.
- **Focus control** -- The `o` parameter controls whether notifications appear when the terminal window is focused, preventing unnecessary interruptions.

:::note
While this protocol originated in kitty, other terminals may implement it as well. Applications seeking broad compatibility may want to detect the terminal type and fall back to OSC 9 or OSC 777 for terminals that do not support OSC 99.

## Examples

```bash
# Simple notification with title and body
printf '\e]99;i=1;p=title;Hello\e\\'
printf '\e]99;i=1;p=body;This is the notification body\e\\'

# Single-part notification (body only, shown as both title and body)
printf '\e]99;;Build complete!\e\\'

# Notification that only appears when terminal is unfocused
printf '\e]99;o=unfocused;p=title;Background Task;p=body;Process finished\e\\'

# Close a notification by identifier
printf '\e]99;i=1;p=close\e\\'
```
