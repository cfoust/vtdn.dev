**OSC 0** sets both the icon name and the window title of the terminal. It is the most commonly used title-setting sequence, emitted by default in many shell prompt configurations.

## Syntax

```
OSC 0 ; Pt BEL
OSC 0 ; Pt ST
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
OSC0 = 0x1b, "]", "0", ";", text, ( 0x07 | 0x1b, "\\\\" ) ;
text = character, { character } ;
`} />

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `Pt` | The text string to use as both the icon name and window title | (none) |

## Description

Per the XTerm control sequences documentation, OSC 0 sets both the icon name and the window title to the string `Pt`. The icon name historically referred to the label displayed when a window was iconified (minimized) in X11 window managers. In modern desktop environments, the icon name is largely vestigial, and most terminals treat OSC 0 as functionally equivalent to setting the window title alone.

The text parameter `Pt` is a free-form string. It is terminated by either BEL (0x07) or ST (String Terminator, ESC \). BEL is more commonly used in practice because it is a single byte and avoids potential parsing issues.

Many shell configurations emit OSC 0 from the prompt to display the current working directory or running command in the terminal's title bar. For example, Bash's default `PROMPT_COMMAND` often includes an OSC 0 sequence.

:::note
OSC 0 sets both the icon name and window title simultaneously. Use [OSC 1](/docs/osc/osc0) to set only the icon name, or [OSC 2](/docs/osc/osc2) to set only the window title.

## Examples

```bash
# Set window title to "My Terminal"
printf '\e]0;My Terminal\a'

# Set window title using ST terminator
printf '\e]0;My Terminal\e\\'

# Set title to current directory (common in shell prompts)
printf '\e]0;%s\a' "$PWD"
```
