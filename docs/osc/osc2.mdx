<StatusBadges status={{ experimental: true }} />

**OSC 2** sets the window title of the terminal without modifying the icon name. In practice, most modern terminals treat this identically to OSC 0 since the icon name distinction is largely obsolete.

## Syntax

```
OSC 2 ; Pt BEL
OSC 2 ; Pt ST
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
OSC2 = 0x1b, "]", "2", ";", text, ( 0x07 | 0x1b, "\\\\" ) ;
text = character, { character } ;
`} />

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `Pt` | The text string to use as the window title | (none) |

## Description

Per the XTerm control sequences documentation, OSC 2 changes the window title to the string `Pt`. Unlike OSC 0, it does not affect the icon name (the label shown when the window is iconified in X11).

In modern terminal emulators, the distinction between icon name and window title is mostly irrelevant. The icon name was meaningful in classic X11 window managers where minimized windows displayed a small icon with a text label. Today, most desktop environments do not expose separate icon names, making OSC 2 and OSC 0 functionally equivalent in nearly all cases.

The text parameter `Pt` is terminated by either BEL (0x07) or ST (String Terminator, ESC \).

## Examples

```bash
# Set window title to "Editor"
printf '\e]2;Editor\a'

# Set window title using ST terminator
printf '\e]2;Editor\e\\'

# Display hostname in title bar
printf '\e]2;%s@%s\a' "$USER" "$HOSTNAME"
```
