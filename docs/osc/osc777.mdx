**OSC 777** sends a desktop notification using the format originally introduced by rxvt-unicode (urxvt). The sequence includes a command name, notification title, and notification body.

## Syntax

```
OSC 777 ; notify ; title ; body ST
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
OSC777 = 0x1b, "]", "777", ";", "notify", ";", title, ";", body, ( 0x07 | 0x1b, "\\\\" ) ;
title  = { printable-char } ;
body   = { printable-char } ;
`} />

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `notify` | The command name (literal string `notify`). |
| `title` | The notification title text. |
| `body` | The notification body text. |

## Description

OSC 777 originated in rxvt-unicode (urxvt) as a general-purpose extension mechanism. The `notify` subcommand triggers a desktop notification with the specified title and body text. The notification is typically displayed using the system's native notification framework (e.g., D-Bus notifications on Linux, Notification Center on macOS).

The general form of OSC 777 is `OSC 777 ; command ; args... ST`, where the command name determines the behavior. The `notify` command is by far the most widely adopted. Other urxvt-specific commands exist but are not commonly supported by other terminals.

### Compared to other notification protocols

| Protocol | Format | Features |
|----------|--------|----------|
| OSC 9 | `OSC 9 ; text ST` | Title only, no body |
| OSC 777 | `OSC 777 ; notify ; title ; body ST` | Title and body |
| OSC 99 (Kitty) | `OSC 99 ; key=value ST` | Rich: identifiers, callbacks, urgency, multi-part |

OSC 777 offers a middle ground between the minimal OSC 9 (which has no body field) and the feature-rich Kitty OSC 99 protocol. For applications that need a simple title-and-body notification with reasonable terminal compatibility, OSC 777 is a practical choice.

:::note
Some terminals only display the notification when the terminal window is not focused, to avoid interrupting the user unnecessarily. Behavior may vary.

## Examples

```bash
# Send a notification with title and body
printf '\e]777;notify;Build Complete;Your project has finished compiling.\e\\'

# Notify when a long-running command finishes
sleep 60 && printf '\e]777;notify;Timer;60 seconds have elapsed.\e\\'

# Using BEL as the string terminator
printf '\e]777;notify;Alert;Something happened.\a'
```
