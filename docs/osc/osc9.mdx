<StatusBadges status={{ experimental: true }} />

**OSC 9** sends a desktop notification from the terminal to the operating system's notification system. Originally introduced by ConEmu, this sequence allows command-line applications to alert the user when a long-running task completes or when attention is needed.

## Syntax

```
OSC 9 ; text ST
OSC 9 ; text BEL
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
OSC9 = 0x1b, "]", "9", ";", text, ( 0x07 | 0x1b, "\\\\" ) ;
text = character, { character } ;
`} />

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `text` | The notification message text to display | (required) |

## Description

Per the ConEmu ANSI codes documentation, OSC 9 triggers a system desktop notification containing the provided text. The notification typically appears as an OS-native notification balloon, toast, or banner depending on the platform.

This is a simple fire-and-forget mechanism with no acknowledgment or response from the terminal. The notification is displayed immediately and follows the OS notification behavior (auto-dismiss, notification center, etc.).

ConEmu extended OSC 9 with additional sub-commands using a semicolon-delimited format:
- `OSC 9 ; 4 ; st ; pr ST` — Progress reporting (see [OSC 9;4](/docs/osc/osc9-4))
- `OSC 9 ; 9 ; path ST` — Set working directory (ConEmu-specific)

Some terminals (notably iTerm2 and Kitty) support OSC 9 for basic desktop notifications but may use different mechanisms for their native notification protocols.

:::note
Desktop notification support varies significantly across terminals. Some terminals require user opt-in for security reasons, as malicious terminal output could otherwise spam notifications.

## Examples

```bash
# Send a simple notification
printf '\e]9;Build complete!\a'

# Notify after a long-running command
make build && printf '\e]9;Build succeeded\a' || printf '\e]9;Build failed!\a'

# Notification with ST terminator
printf '\e]9;Task finished\e\\'
```
