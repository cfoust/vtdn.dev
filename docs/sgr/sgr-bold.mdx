**Bold** (SGR 1) is an SGR attribute that renders text with increased intensity or a heavier font weight.

## Syntax

```
CSI 1 m     SGR 1 — Bold / increased intensity
CSI 22 m    SGR 22 — Normal intensity (reset bold and dim)
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
SGR-bold       = 0x1b, "[", "1", "m" ;
SGR-normal-int = 0x1b, "[", "22", "m" ;
`} />

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.117, SGR parameter 1 selects "bold or increased intensity." The effect is implementation-defined but typically manifests as either a heavier font weight, brighter colors, or both.

On most modern terminals, bold text is rendered using a heavier font weight from the same font family. Many terminals also shift the foreground color to its "bright" variant when bold is active and a standard (non-RGB) color is in use.

Bold is reset by SGR 22, which restores normal intensity. Note that SGR 22 also cancels dim (SGR 2) — there is no way to reset bold independently of dim using standard sequences. SGR 0 (reset all) also clears bold.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[1mBold text\e[22m Normal text\n'
printf '\e[1;31mBold red\e[0m\n'
```
