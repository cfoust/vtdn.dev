**Dim** (SGR 2) is an SGR attribute that renders text with decreased intensity or a lighter appearance.

## Syntax

```
CSI 2 m     SGR 2 — Faint / decreased intensity
CSI 22 m    SGR 22 — Normal intensity (reset bold and dim)
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
SGR-dim        = 0x1b, "[", "2", "m" ;
SGR-normal-int = 0x1b, "[", "22", "m" ;
`} />

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.117, SGR parameter 2 selects "faint, decreased intensity or second colour." Terminals typically render this by reducing the opacity or brightness of the foreground color.

Dim is reset by SGR 22, which restores normal intensity. Note that SGR 22 also cancels bold (SGR 1). SGR 0 (reset all) also clears dim.

Bold and dim are mutually exclusive on some terminals, while others allow both to be active simultaneously (with implementation-defined results).

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[2mDim text\e[22m Normal text\n'
printf '\e[2;33mDim yellow\e[0m\n'
```
