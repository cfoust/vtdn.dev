**Double underline** (SGR 21) is an SGR attribute that renders text with two underlines below the baseline.

## Syntax

```
CSI 21 m    SGR 21 — Double underline
CSI 24 m    SGR 24 — Not underlined
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
SGR-double-underline = 0x1b, "[", "21", "m" ;
SGR-not-underline    = 0x1b, "[", "24", "m" ;
`} />

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.117, SGR parameter 21 selects "doubly underlined." Two parallel lines are drawn below the text baseline.

Double underline is reset by SGR 24 (which cancels all underline variants) or SGR 0.

SGR 21 can also be expressed as `SGR 4:2` in the sub-parameter syntax defined by ITU-T T.416. Some terminals support one form but not the other.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[21mDouble underlined\e[24m Normal\n'
printf '\e[4:2mAlternate syntax\e[24m\n'
```
