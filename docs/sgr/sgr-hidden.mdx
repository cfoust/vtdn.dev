**Hidden** (SGR 8) is an SGR attribute that makes text invisible by rendering it in the same color as the background.

## Syntax

```
CSI 8 m     SGR 8 — Hidden (concealed)
CSI 28 m    SGR 28 — Not hidden (revealed)
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
SGR-hidden  = 0x1b, "[", "8", "m" ;
SGR-visible = 0x1b, "[", "28", "m" ;
`} />

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.117, SGR parameter 8 selects "concealed characters." The text is still present in the terminal buffer and can be selected/copied, but it is not visually displayed.

Hidden is reset by SGR 28 or SGR 0.

The typical implementation renders the text with the foreground color set to the background color, making it invisible. Some terminals may implement this differently or not support it at all.

:::note
Hidden text is not a security feature — the text remains in the terminal buffer and is typically accessible via copy/paste or screen scraping.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[8mHidden text\e[28m Visible text\n'
```
