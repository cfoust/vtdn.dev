**Italic** (SGR 3) is an SGR attribute that renders text in an italic or oblique style.

## Syntax

```
CSI 3 m     SGR 3 — Italic
CSI 23 m    SGR 23 — Not italic, not Fraktur
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
SGR-italic     = 0x1b, "[", "3", "m" ;
SGR-not-italic = 0x1b, "[", "23", "m" ;
`} />

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.117, SGR parameter 3 selects "italicized." Text is rendered using the italic variant of the current font, or an oblique (slanted) version if no true italic is available.

Italic is reset by SGR 23 or SGR 0. Note that SGR 23 also cancels Fraktur (SGR 20), though Fraktur is rarely supported.

Italic support requires the terminal's font to include an italic face. If the font lacks italics, some terminals synthesize an oblique style by slanting the glyphs.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[3mItalic text\e[23m Normal text\n'
printf '\e[1;3mBold italic\e[0m\n'
```
