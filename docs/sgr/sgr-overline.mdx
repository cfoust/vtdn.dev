**Overline** (SGR 53) is an SGR attribute that renders text with a line above the characters.

## Syntax

```
CSI 53 m    SGR 53 — Overlined
CSI 55 m    SGR 55 — Not overlined
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
SGR-overline     = 0x1b, "[", "53", "m" ;
SGR-not-overline = 0x1b, "[", "55", "m" ;
`} />

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.117, SGR parameter 53 selects "overlined." A horizontal line is drawn above the text.

Overline is reset by SGR 55 or SGR 0.

Overline is less commonly supported than underline or strikethrough. It was defined in ECMA-48 but was not implemented on DEC VT terminals.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[53mOverlined text\e[55m Normal text\n'
```
