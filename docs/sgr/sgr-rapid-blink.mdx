**Rapid blink** (SGR 6) is an SGR attribute that causes text to blink at a rapid rate.

## Syntax

```
CSI 6 m     SGR 6 — Rapid blink
CSI 25 m    SGR 25 — Not blinking (steady)
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
SGR-rapid-blink = 0x1b, "[", "6", "m" ;
SGR-steady      = 0x1b, "[", "25", "m" ;
`} />

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.117, SGR parameter 6 selects "rapidly blinking (150 per minute or more)." This is a faster blink rate than SGR 5 (slow blink).

Rapid blink is reset by SGR 25 or SGR 0.

Rapid blink is very rarely supported. Most terminals that support blinking at all treat SGR 6 the same as SGR 5 (slow blink) or ignore it entirely. The DEC VT terminals did not support rapid blink.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[6mRapid blinking text\e[25m Steady text\n'
```
