**Reverse video** (SGR 7) is an SGR attribute that swaps the foreground and background colors of the text.

## Syntax

```
CSI 7 m     SGR 7 — Reverse video (negative image)
CSI 27 m    SGR 27 — Not reversed (positive image)
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
SGR-reverse     = 0x1b, "[", "7", "m" ;
SGR-not-reverse = 0x1b, "[", "27", "m" ;
`} />

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.117, SGR parameter 7 selects "negative image." The foreground and background colors are exchanged so that text appears in the background color on a foreground-colored background.

Reverse is reset by SGR 27 or SGR 0.

Reverse video applies after all other color attributes have been resolved. If the foreground is explicitly set to red and the background to white, reverse video will display white text on a red background.

Reverse video is supported by virtually all terminals and has been available since the VT100.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[7mReversed\e[27m Normal\n'
printf '\e[31;7mReverse red (red background, default fg)\e[0m\n'
```
