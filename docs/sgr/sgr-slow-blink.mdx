**Slow blink** (SGR 5) is an SGR attribute that causes text to blink at a slow rate.

## Syntax

```
CSI 5 m     SGR 5 — Slow blink
CSI 25 m    SGR 25 — Not blinking (steady)
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
SGR-slow-blink = 0x1b, "[", "5", "m" ;
SGR-steady     = 0x1b, "[", "25", "m" ;
`} />

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.117, SGR parameter 5 selects "slowly blinking (less than 150 per minute)." The text alternates between visible and hidden (or between foreground and background) at a rate below 150 cycles per minute (less than 2.5 Hz).

Blinking is reset by SGR 25 or SGR 0. SGR 25 cancels both slow blink (SGR 5) and rapid blink (SGR 6).

Many modern terminals do not implement blinking at all, treating SGR 5 as a no-op. Some terminals support it but allow users to disable it in preferences. A few terminals (notably XTerm) support blink when configured to do so.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[5mBlinking text\e[25m Steady text\n'
```
