**Strikethrough** (SGR 9) is an SGR attribute that renders text with a horizontal line through the middle.

## Syntax

```
CSI 9 m     SGR 9 — Strikethrough (crossed out)
CSI 29 m    SGR 29 — Not strikethrough
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
SGR-strikethrough     = 0x1b, "[", "9", "m" ;
SGR-not-strikethrough = 0x1b, "[", "29", "m" ;
`} />

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.117, SGR parameter 9 selects "crossed-out (characters still legible but marked as to be deleted)." A horizontal line is drawn through the center of each character.

Strikethrough is reset by SGR 29 or SGR 0.

Strikethrough was not supported on DEC VT terminals. It is widely supported by modern terminal emulators.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[9mStrikethrough text\e[29m Normal text\n'
printf '\e[9;31mRed strikethrough\e[0m\n'
```
