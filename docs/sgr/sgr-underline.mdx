**Underline** (SGR 4) is an SGR attribute that renders text with an underline below the baseline.

## Syntax

```
CSI 4 m     SGR 4 — Single underline
CSI 24 m    SGR 24 — Not underlined
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
SGR-underline     = 0x1b, "[", "4", "m" ;
SGR-not-underline = 0x1b, "[", "24", "m" ;
`} />

## Description

Per ECMA-48 §8.3.117, SGR parameter 4 selects "singly underlined." A line is drawn below the text baseline.

Underline is reset by SGR 24 or SGR 0. SGR 24 cancels all underline variants (single, double, curly, dotted, dashed).

Some terminals support extended underline styles using the sub-parameter syntax `SGR 4:n` where `n` specifies the style. This is based on ITU-T T.416 and the Kitty underline extension. The basic `SGR 4` (equivalent to `SGR 4:1`) selects a single straight underline.

The underline color defaults to the foreground color but can be overridden with SGR 58 (underline color).

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[4mUnderlined text\e[24m Normal text\n'
printf '\e[4;31mRed underlined text\e[0m\n'
```
