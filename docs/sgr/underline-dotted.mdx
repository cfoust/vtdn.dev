**Dotted underline** (SGR 4:4) is an extended underline style that renders a dotted line below the text.

## Syntax

```
CSI 4:4 m    SGR 4:4 — Dotted underline
CSI 24 m     SGR 24 — Not underlined
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
SGR-dotted-underline = 0x1b, "[", "4:4", "m" ;
SGR-not-underline    = 0x1b, "[", "24", "m" ;
`} />

## Description

SGR 4:4 selects a dotted underline style using the sub-parameter syntax from the Kitty underline extension. The line below the text is rendered as a series of dots rather than a continuous line.

Dotted underline is reset by SGR 24 or SGR 0.

The underline color can be set independently using SGR 58.

## Examples

```bash
printf '\e[4:4mDotted underlined text\e[24m Normal text\n'
```
