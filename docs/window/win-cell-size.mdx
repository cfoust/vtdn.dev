**Cell Size** is an XTerm window manipulation sequence that queries the pixel dimensions of an individual character cell in the terminal.

## Syntax

```
CSI 16 t                       Request cell size in pixels
CSI 6 ; height ; width t       Response: cell pixel dimensions
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
(* Request *)
cell_size_request  = 0x1b, "[", "1", "6", "t" ;

(* Response *)
cell_size_response = 0x1b, "[", "6", ";", Pn, ";", Pn, "t" ;
Pn                 = digit, { digit } ;
digit              = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4"
                   | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
`} />

### Response

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `height` | Height of a single character cell in pixels |
| `width` | Width of a single character cell in pixels |

## Description

This sequence queries the terminal for the pixel dimensions of a single character cell. It is part of the XTerm `CSI Ps ; Ps ; Ps t` window manipulation family.

When the terminal receives `CSI 16 t`, it responds with `CSI 6 ; height ; width t` where `height` and `width` are the pixel dimensions of a single character cell. The cell size is determined by the current font and its rendering configuration.

Typical cell sizes for common monospace fonts are in the range of 7-10 pixels wide by 14-20 pixels tall, though high-DPI displays and font scaling can produce larger values.

The cell size report is particularly useful for:

- **Graphics protocols**: Applications that render inline graphics (such as [Sixel](/docs/graphics/sixel) or [Kitty Graphics](/docs/graphics/kitty-graphics)) need the cell size to correctly scale images to align with the character grid.
- **Size calculations**: Dividing the [Text Area Size (pixels)](/docs/window/win-text-area-pixels) by the cell size yields the text area dimensions in characters.
- **Mouse position mapping**: Converting pixel-based mouse coordinates to character cell positions.

## Examples

```bash
# Query cell size
printf '\e[16t'

# Read the response
printf '\e[16t'; read -st 1 -d t response; echo "$response"
```
