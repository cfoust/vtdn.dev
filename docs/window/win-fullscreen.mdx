**Fullscreen** is an XTerm window manipulation sequence that enters, exits, or toggles fullscreen mode for the terminal window.

## Syntax

```
CSI 10 ; Ps t     Enter, exit, or toggle fullscreen
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
fullscreen = 0x1b, "[", "1", "0", ";", Ps, "t" ;
Ps         = "0" | "1" | "2" ;
`} />

### Parameters

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `0` | Exit fullscreen (restore to windowed mode) |
| `1` | Enter fullscreen |
| `2` | Toggle fullscreen |

## Description

This sequence controls the fullscreen state of the terminal window. It is part of the XTerm `CSI Ps ; Ps ; Ps t` window manipulation family.

- **`CSI 10 ; 0 t`** — Exits fullscreen mode. The window is restored to its previous windowed size and position, with window decorations visible.
- **`CSI 10 ; 1 t`** — Enters fullscreen mode. The window expands to cover the entire screen, and window decorations (title bar, borders) are hidden.
- **`CSI 10 ; 2 t`** — Toggles fullscreen mode. If the window is currently in fullscreen, it exits fullscreen; if windowed, it enters fullscreen.

Fullscreen mode differs from [Maximize](/docs/window/win-maximize) in that fullscreen typically removes all window decorations and may cover system UI elements such as taskbars and docks. Maximize mode retains decorations and respects the work area.

:::note
Some terminal emulators disable these sequences by default for security reasons. Check your terminal's configuration for options to enable or disable window manipulation sequences.
