<StatusBadges status={{ experimental: true }} />

**Iconify** and **De-iconify** are XTerm window manipulation sequences that minimize (iconify) or restore (de-iconify) the terminal window.

## Syntax

```
CSI 1 t     De-iconify (restore/raise) window
CSI 2 t     Iconify (minimize) window
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
de_iconify = 0x1b, "[", "1", "t" ;
iconify    = 0x1b, "[", "2", "t" ;
`} />

## Description

These sequences control the iconified (minimized) state of the terminal window. They are part of the XTerm `CSI Ps ; Ps ; Ps t` window manipulation family.

- **`CSI 1 t`** — De-iconifies the window. If the window is currently minimized, it is restored to its previous size and position and raised to the front of the window stack.
- **`CSI 2 t`** — Iconifies the window. The window is minimized to the taskbar or dock, removing it from the visible desktop.

These operations map directly to the corresponding window manager actions. On systems without a traditional window manager (such as tiling window managers or terminal multiplexers), these sequences may be ignored or have no visible effect.

The [Window State Report](/docs/window/win-state-report) (`CSI 11 t`) can be used to query the current iconified state of the window.

:::note
Some terminal emulators disable these sequences by default for security reasons, as a malicious application could minimize a user's terminal unexpectedly. Check your terminal's configuration for options to enable or disable window manipulation sequences.

## Examples

```bash
# Minimize the terminal window
printf '\e[2t'

# Restore the terminal window
printf '\e[1t'
```
