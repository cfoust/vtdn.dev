<StatusBadges status={{ experimental: true }} />

**Maximize** is an XTerm window manipulation sequence that maximizes or restores the terminal window, with options for full, vertical-only, or horizontal-only maximization.

## Syntax

```
CSI 9 ; Ps t     Maximize or restore window
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
maximize = 0x1b, "[", "9", ";", Ps, "t" ;
Ps       = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" ;
`} />

### Parameters

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `0` | Restore (un-maximize) the window |
| `1` | Maximize the window (fill the screen) |
| `2` | Maximize the window vertically (full height, keep current width) |
| `3` | Maximize the window horizontally (full width, keep current height) |

## Description

This sequence controls the maximized state of the terminal window. It is part of the XTerm `CSI Ps ; Ps ; Ps t` window manipulation family.

- **`CSI 9 ; 0 t`** — Restores the window to its size and position before it was maximized.
- **`CSI 9 ; 1 t`** — Maximizes the window to fill the entire screen (or the work area, excluding taskbars and docks).
- **`CSI 9 ; 2 t`** — Maximizes the window vertically only. The window expands to full screen height while retaining its current width and horizontal position.
- **`CSI 9 ; 3 t`** — Maximizes the window horizontally only. The window expands to full screen width while retaining its current height and vertical position.

The vertical and horizontal maximize modes can be combined by issuing both sequences in succession.

This is distinct from [Fullscreen](/docs/window/win-fullscreen) mode, which removes window decorations and typically covers the entire display including taskbars.

:::note
Some terminal emulators disable these sequences by default for security reasons. Check your terminal's configuration for options to enable or disable window manipulation sequences. Partial maximization (vertical/horizontal only) may not be supported by all terminals.
