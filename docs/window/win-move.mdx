<StatusBadges status={{ experimental: true }} />

**Move Window** is an XTerm window manipulation sequence that repositions the terminal window to a specified pixel coordinate on the screen.

## Syntax

```
CSI 3 ; x ; y t     Move window to pixel position (x, y)
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
move_window = 0x1b, "[", "3", ";", Pn, ";", Pn, "t" ;
Pn          = digit, { digit } ;
digit       = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4"
            | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
`} />

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `x` | Horizontal pixel position from the left edge of the screen | 0 |
| `y` | Vertical pixel position from the top edge of the screen | 0 |

## Description

This sequence moves the terminal window so that its top-left corner is positioned at the pixel coordinates (`x`, `y`) relative to the top-left corner of the display. It is part of the XTerm `CSI Ps ; Ps ; Ps t` window manipulation family.

The coordinate system uses the screen's origin (0, 0) at the top-left corner, with `x` increasing to the right and `y` increasing downward. Coordinates are specified in pixels.

If the specified position would place the window partially or fully off-screen, the behavior depends on the window manager. Most window managers will clamp the position to keep at least part of the window visible.

The [Window Position Report](/docs/window/win-position-report) (`CSI 13 t`) can be used to query the current position of the window.

:::note
Some terminal emulators disable this sequence by default for security reasons, as a malicious application could move the terminal window off-screen. Check your terminal's configuration for options to enable or disable window manipulation sequences.

## Examples

```bash
# Move window to top-left corner of screen
printf '\e[3;0;0t'

# Move window to position (100, 200)
printf '\e[3;100;200t'
```
