**Window Position Report** is an XTerm window manipulation sequence that queries the pixel position of the terminal window on the screen.

## Syntax

```
CSI 13 t               Request window position
CSI 13 ; 2 t           Request text area position
CSI 3 ; x ; y t        Response: pixel position
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
(* Request — window position *)
position_request      = 0x1b, "[", "1", "3", "t" ;

(* Request — text area position *)
text_area_pos_request = 0x1b, "[", "1", "3", ";", "2", "t" ;

(* Response *)
position_response     = 0x1b, "[", "3", ";", Pn, ";", Pn, "t" ;
Pn                    = digit, { digit } ;
digit                 = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4"
                      | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
`} />

### Response

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `x` | Horizontal pixel position from the left edge of the screen |
| `y` | Vertical pixel position from the top edge of the screen |

## Description

This sequence queries the terminal for the pixel position of the window on the screen. It is part of the XTerm `CSI Ps ; Ps ; Ps t` window manipulation family.

- **`CSI 13 t`** — Requests the position of the terminal window. The terminal responds with `CSI 3 ; x ; y t` where `x` and `y` are the pixel coordinates of the top-left corner of the window.
- **`CSI 13 ; 2 t`** — Requests the position of the text area (the region where characters are rendered, excluding window decorations). The terminal responds with the same `CSI 3 ; x ; y t` format, but with the coordinates of the text area's top-left corner.

The coordinate system uses the screen's origin (0, 0) at the top-left corner, with `x` increasing to the right and `y` increasing downward. The response format matches the parameter format of the [Move Window](/docs/window/win-move) sequence (`CSI 3 ; x ; y t`).

## Examples

```bash
# Query window position
printf '\e[13t'

# Query text area position
printf '\e[13;2t'

# Read the response
printf '\e[13t'; read -st 1 -d t response; echo "$response"
```
