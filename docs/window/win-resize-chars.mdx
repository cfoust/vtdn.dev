**Resize (chars)** is an XTerm window manipulation sequence that resizes the terminal window's text area to the specified number of rows and columns.

## Syntax

```
CSI 8 ; rows ; cols t     Resize text area to character dimensions
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
resize_chars = 0x1b, "[", "8", ";", Pn, ";", Pn, "t" ;
Pn           = digit, { digit } ;
digit        = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4"
             | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
`} />

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `rows` | Number of character rows in the text area | (unchanged) |
| `cols` | Number of character columns in the text area | (unchanged) |

## Description

This sequence resizes the terminal window so that the text area contains exactly the specified number of rows and columns. It is part of the XTerm `CSI Ps ; Ps ; Ps t` window manipulation family.

The resulting pixel size depends on the current cell dimensions. For example, resizing to 80 columns by 24 rows with a cell size of 8x16 pixels would produce a text area of 640x384 pixels. The total window size will be larger due to window decorations and padding.

If a parameter is omitted or zero, that dimension should remain unchanged, though behavior varies between implementations. This is the preferred method for resizing a terminal to a standard size (e.g., 80x24 or 132x43) because it operates in the same units that applications use.

The [Text Area Size (chars)](/docs/window/win-text-area-chars) report (`CSI 18 t`) can be used to query the current text area dimensions in characters after resizing.

:::note
Some terminal emulators disable this sequence by default for security reasons. Check your terminal's configuration for options to enable or disable window manipulation sequences.

## Examples

```bash
# Resize to standard 80x24 terminal
printf '\e[8;24;80t'

# Resize to 132-column mode (DEC wide)
printf '\e[8;43;132t'

# Resize to 120 columns, 40 rows
printf '\e[8;40;120t'
```
