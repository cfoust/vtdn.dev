**Window State Report** is an XTerm window manipulation sequence that queries whether the terminal window is currently iconified (minimized) or open.

## Syntax

```
CSI 11 t           Request window state
CSI 1 t            Response: window is open (not iconified)
CSI 2 t            Response: window is iconified
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
(* Request *)
state_request  = 0x1b, "[", "1", "1", "t" ;

(* Response *)
state_response = 0x1b, "[", Ps, "t" ;
Ps             = "1" | "2" ;                (* 1 = open, 2 = iconified *)
`} />

### Response

| Response | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `CSI 1 t` | Window is open (not iconified) |
| `CSI 2 t` | Window is iconified (minimized) |

## Description

This sequence queries the terminal for its current iconified state. It is part of the XTerm `CSI Ps ; Ps ; Ps t` window manipulation family.

When the terminal receives `CSI 11 t`, it responds on the input stream with either `CSI 1 t` (if the window is open and visible) or `CSI 2 t` (if the window is iconified/minimized).

Note that the response values (`1` and `2`) correspond to the same parameter values used by the [Iconify](/docs/window/win-iconify) sequences: `CSI 1 t` (de-iconify) and `CSI 2 t` (iconify). Care must be taken when parsing responses to distinguish between a state report response and other window manipulation sequences.

Applications may use this report to detect whether the user has minimized the terminal window, allowing them to pause rendering or reduce resource usage while the window is not visible.

## Examples

```bash
# Query window state
printf '\e[11t'

# Read the response
printf '\e[11t'; read -st 1 -d t response; echo "$response"
```
