<StatusBadges status={{ experimental: true }} />

**Text Area Size (chars)** is an XTerm window manipulation sequence that queries the character dimensions (rows and columns) of the terminal's text area.

## Syntax

```
CSI 18 t                     Request text area size in characters
CSI 8 ; rows ; cols t        Response: character dimensions
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
(* Request *)
text_area_chars_request  = 0x1b, "[", "1", "8", "t" ;

(* Response *)
text_area_chars_response = 0x1b, "[", "8", ";", Pn, ";", Pn, "t" ;
Pn                       = digit, { digit } ;
digit                    = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4"
                         | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
`} />

### Response

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `rows` | Number of character rows in the text area |
| `cols` | Number of character columns in the text area |

## Description

This sequence queries the terminal for the size of the text area measured in characters (rows and columns). It is part of the XTerm `CSI Ps ; Ps ; Ps t` window manipulation family.

When the terminal receives `CSI 18 t`, it responds with `CSI 8 ; rows ; cols t` where `rows` is the number of character rows and `cols` is the number of character columns in the text area. The response format matches the parameter format of the [Resize (chars)](/docs/window/win-resize-chars) sequence (`CSI 8 ; rows ; cols t`).

This report provides the same information as the `TIOCGWINSZ` ioctl or the `COLUMNS` and `LINES` environment variables, but it works over any transport (including serial connections and SSH tunnels) without requiring out-of-band signaling.

Applications may prefer this over the [Text Area Size (pixels)](/docs/window/win-text-area-pixels) report when they only need character dimensions and do not perform pixel-level operations.

## Examples

```bash
# Query text area size in characters
printf '\e[18t'

# Read the response
printf '\e[18t'; read -st 1 -d t response; echo "$response"
```
