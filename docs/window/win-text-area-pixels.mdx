**Text Area Size (pixels)** is an XTerm window manipulation sequence that queries the pixel dimensions of the terminal's text area.

## Syntax

```
CSI 14 t                   Request text area size in pixels
CSI 14 ; 2 t               Request window size in pixels
CSI 4 ; height ; width t   Response: pixel dimensions
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
(* Request — text area size *)
text_area_request = 0x1b, "[", "1", "4", "t" ;

(* Request — window size *)
window_size_request = 0x1b, "[", "1", "4", ";", "2", "t" ;

(* Response *)
size_response     = 0x1b, "[", "4", ";", Pn, ";", Pn, "t" ;
Pn                = digit, { digit } ;
digit             = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4"
                  | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
`} />

### Response

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `height` | Height of the text area in pixels |
| `width` | Width of the text area in pixels |

## Description

This sequence queries the terminal for the pixel size of the text area or the entire window. It is part of the XTerm `CSI Ps ; Ps ; Ps t` window manipulation family.

- **`CSI 14 t`** — Requests the size of the text area (the region where characters are rendered, excluding window decorations, scroll bars, and padding). The terminal responds with `CSI 4 ; height ; width t`.
- **`CSI 14 ; 2 t`** — Requests the size of the entire window, including decorations. The terminal responds with the same `CSI 4 ; height ; width t` format.

The response format matches the parameter format of the [Resize (pixels)](/docs/window/win-resize-pixels) sequence (`CSI 4 ; height ; width t`). This symmetry means you can query the current size and later restore it using the same values.

The text area pixel size, combined with the [Cell Size](/docs/window/win-cell-size) report, can be used to calculate the number of character rows and columns, which is equivalent to the [Text Area Size (chars)](/docs/window/win-text-area-chars) report.

## Examples

```bash
# Query text area size in pixels
printf '\e[14t'

# Query window size in pixels (including decorations)
printf '\e[14;2t'

# Read the response
printf '\e[14t'; read -st 1 -d t response; echo "$response"
```
