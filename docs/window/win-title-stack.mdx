**Title Stack** provides XTerm window manipulation sequences for pushing and popping window and icon titles on a stack, allowing applications to save and restore the terminal's title.

## Syntax

```
CSI 22 ; Ps t     Push title to stack
CSI 23 ; Ps t     Pop title from stack
```

<FormalSyntax grammar={`
push_title = 0x1b, "[", "2", "2", ";", Ps, "t" ;
pop_title  = 0x1b, "[", "2", "3", ";", Ps, "t" ;
Ps         = "0" | "1" | "2" ;
`} />

### Parameters

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `0` | Push or pop both the icon title and the window title |
| `1` | Push or pop the icon title only |
| `2` | Push or pop the window title only |

## Description

These sequences manage a stack of window and icon titles, allowing applications to save the current title before changing it and restore the original title afterward. They are part of the XTerm `CSI Ps ; Ps ; Ps t` window manipulation family.

- **`CSI 22 ; Ps t`** (Push) — Saves the current title(s) onto an internal stack. The title can then be changed freely using [OSC 0](/docs/osc/osc0) or [OSC 2](/docs/osc/osc2), knowing it can be restored later.
- **`CSI 23 ; Ps t`** (Pop) — Restores the most recently pushed title(s) from the stack and sets them as the current title(s). If the stack is empty, the operation has no effect.

The `Ps` parameter controls which titles are affected:

| `Ps` | Push behavior | Pop behavior |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| `0` | Saves both the icon and window title | Restores both titles |
| `1` | Saves the icon title only | Restores the icon title only |
| `2` | Saves the window title only | Restores the window title only |

The title stack is particularly useful for applications that temporarily change the terminal title (for example, to display a filename or status) and need to restore the user's original title upon exit. Using the stack avoids the need for the application to query and store the original title itself.

The stack operates in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner. Multiple push operations can be performed before popping, and each pop restores the most recently pushed value.

## Examples

```bash
# Save both titles, change title, then restore
printf '\e[22;0t'              # Push current titles
printf '\e]2;My Application\a' # Set new window title
# ... application runs ...
printf '\e[23;0t'              # Restore original titles

# Save only the window title
printf '\e[22;2t'              # Push window title
printf '\e]2;Working...\a'     # Set temporary title
printf '\e[23;2t'              # Restore window title
```
